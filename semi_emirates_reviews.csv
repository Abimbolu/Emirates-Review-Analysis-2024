Andy,United Kingdom,4,"Cancelled Return (But wasn't)
I booked a return car service through Emirates via their Cartrawler service. It was farmed out to JayRide. It was to collect my family of 4 from Dubai airport and take us to RIXOS in ABU DHABI. The pick up worked fine, (although they did keep us waiting in the terminal for about 15mins while the car arrived), but then the day before the return on the 4th Jan i received a WhatsApp stating the booking had been cancelled. I shared screen shot of the website showing it as confirmed but i got little help or interest from the rep at Jayride. He basically said contact the agent. I had no number for Cartrawler and Emirate's were of zero help too stating the service is managed by Cartrawler.
In the end I wasted 2 hours of my last day of holiday trying to save this transfer.
In the end I had to resort to buying another transfer from the hotel which cost me twice as much.
So i am now down £200.

Akshay Iyer,United Arab Emirates,3,"Disappointed with Emirates' Customer Service
I’m incredibly disappointed with Emirates' customer service. My checked bag was damaged during a flight two months ago, and despite being a Skywards Silver member, the experience has been nothing short of frustrating.

It took them one month just to reply to my initial complaint. After that, I promptly provided all the information they requested, and now weeks have passed with no further response. Their customer service is impossible to reach—there’s no way to reply to their emails, and speaking to an actual person seems out of the question.

For an airline that prides itself on excellence, this level of service is shocking. I expected better from Emirates. If they can’t handle a simple baggage claim, what does that say about their overall customer care?

Dave Blackburn,United Kingdom,50,"Not as expected for the price.
For one of the highest rated airlines I was expecting better. I upgraded to Emirates from a competitor because I wanted to experience the hyped up customer service experience, the comfort of the A380 and to be treated special on our trip of a lifetime to Singapore via Dubai.
First the plus point. Checking in at Manchester and boarding was as smooth as could be.
The presentation of the cabin was good.
The aircraft arrived into Dubai on time despite a delay at Manchester. The transfer though rushed was smooth through Dubai.
The food quality onboard was excellent and tasty.
The bad points. The cabin crew were not very friendly and I felt that they thought they were a cut above the paying passengers. The seats onboard are awful. The posture is forcing your back into in natural positions. There’s that much stuff left on the seat for you to use in flight it’s hard to take your seat. Leg room is cramped for these long haul flights. The airline doesn’t have available two pin headphone adapters to borrow. Why these even a thing these days I don’t know. My biggest gripe of all though is the cabin crew ration the drinks on board. Again they don’t make it known you can get more refreshments if you require them. We arrived into Dubai and Singapore gasping for a drink. Emirates don’t promote the need to stay hydrated well and considering the ticket price difference refreshments should be constantly available. It might have been nice to allow us to buy them if they are too tight to give them away as part of the ticket price.
Would I fly with them again? Possibly but I’d want more inflight drinks.",,,not as expected for the price for one of the highest rated airlines i was expecting better i upgraded to emirates from a competitor because i wanted to experience the hyped up customer service experience the comfort of the a and to be treated special on our trip of a lifetime to singapore via dubai first the plus point checking in at manchester and boarding was as smooth as could be the presentation of the cabin was good the aircraft arrived into dubai on time despite a delay at manchester the transfer though rushed was smooth through dubai the food quality onboard was excellent and tasty the bad points the cabin crew were not very friendly and i felt that they thought they were a cut above the paying passengers the seats onboard are awful the posture is forcing your back into in natural positions there s that much stuff left on the seat for you to use in flight it s hard to take your seat leg room is cramped for these long haul flights the airline doesn t have available two pin headphone adapters to borrow why these even a thing these days i don t know my biggest gripe of all though is the cabin crew ration the drinks on board again they don t make it known you can get more refreshments if you require them we arrived into dubai and singapore gasping for a drink emirates don t promote the need to stay hydrated well and considering the ticket price difference refreshments should be constantly available it might have been nice to allow us to buy them if they are too tight to give them away as part of the ticket price would i fly with them again possibly but i d want more inflight drinks ,0.8079,Positive,Cabin Crew

Jane Abou jaoude,United Arab Emirates,6,"I had a horrible experience with…
I had a horrible experience with Emirates Airlines regarding my damaged luggage during my flight from Cairo to Dubai. I traveled in First Class with an expensive bag that they broke. While still at the airport, I contacted them, and they directed me to their website to submit a claim form. I trusted their process, followed the steps, and submitted everything, including photos of the bag before and after the damage.

After waiting for over a month with no response, I contacted their customer service multiple times, only to be told it might take over a month just to get an answer. Today, I received an email from them claiming they are not responsible for the damage and that it’s “my own responsibility.” This is completely unacceptable.

To make matters worse, I cannot even respond to their email, as their system blocks replies. This lack of accountability and communication is shocking for a company of their reputation. Flydubai, in contrast, has always taken responsibility for such issues in the past.

I expected much better service from Emirates, especially traveling First Class. I have all the evidence—boarding pass, luggage tags, and clear photos of the damage—and yet they refuse to acknowledge their fault. The broken luggage is not “minor damage,” as they claim. It’s completely unacceptable for Emirates to avoid responsibility like this.

Zavylot,United Kingdom,23,"Disappointed
We booked our holiday to Thailand with Emirates Holidays. Our hotel and transfers were fine but the flights to Thailand were awful. The cabin crew appear to be poorly trained, hence poor service. They advertise that we should drink plenty of water but when we requested a glass of water in order to take important medication, we were told “you will have to wait”. The water never came. We asked for a beer, we were told “I will see if there are any left”. Again, no drinks offered. We were only offered drinks with the meal/snack that was served during the flight.

When we arrived in Dubai, we decided to purchase our own bottled water to take with us on our connecting flight.

The flight to Thailand was even worse. A certain group of passengers who were obviously known to cabin crew were extremely well looked after, staff offering a continuous flow of beer, only to them. The comfort of other passengers was disregarded. Totally unprofessional behaviour!

We weren’t looking forward to our flight home but we needn’t have worried, it was fine, obviously better trained, more professional cabin crew.

Catherine,Singapore,13,"Their planes are fine, but their people suck
We've taken several Emirates flights now so I think I'm giving a pretty fair judgment of the airline when I say the main thing it has going for it are its planes -- the cleanliness and structure of the seats and the excellence of the inflight entertainment options. But that's about it -- the airline's PEOPLE are horrible, truly between below-par to downright unpleasant. From the anal-retentive check-in counter staff who was determined to be as difficult as possible about letting me bring on board one carry-on and one backpack (small laptop size, and which has definitely easily fit under the seat on countless flights, including other Emirate ones) to the cabin crew who NEVER answer the passenger call button, NEVER -- NOT ONCE.

I believe that constructive feedback is essential for improvement. Therefore, I urge you to address this matter with your staff to ensure that all customers receive the level of service and respect they deserve. I would like to hear some action.

akhila atk,United States,1,"Worst Experience with Emirates
Worst Experience with Emirates – Never Again!

I had the worst experience flying with Emirates, and I’ll never book with them again. To start with, they have a ridiculous policy where you're only allowed one piece of luggage – this includes your carry-on and your handbag or backpack. As a working professional with a laptop, how can they expect me to not carry my laptop bag? It's absolutely unreasonable to ask someone to pack a laptop in their carry-on suitcase and then remove it every time you go through security.

To make matters worse, they insisted that I check in my carry-on and demanded a $225 fee, which is outrageous. If I had checked in an extra bag, it would have only cost $150. This feels like an attempt to rip people off. I’ve flown internationally many times and have never encountered such poor customer service and illogical policies.

I have been flying Business Class with Emirates for 18 months now and here are my observations:

*The cabin crew are either very good and go the extra mile to look after you or really bad and spend their time chatting amongst themselves and ignoring passengers.
*The Business lounge in Dubai is probably one of the worst I have used. Very dated, noisy, dirty and not enough toilets.
*The A380's are great to fly on but the aging 777's are well past their sell by dates. The aircraft that they use on their African routes are the oldest in the fleet, with some not even having touch ICE screens. They are very dirty.
*Their Skywards rewards program is very poor and needs to be more generous towards business travelers and it is difficult to progress even when taking 12 regular long haul flights throughout the year. Despite spending $50,000 per annum it is impossible for me to progress beyond Gold membership.
*Impossible to upgrade to 1st Class using Skywards points, though they are happy to upgrade you for money.

Nothing wrong with the flight itself, even if I would have expected more overall. However, the customer service is unexpectedly disastrous.
In detail: We flew from Hamburg to Tokyo and from Tokyo back to Hamburg. Our luggage consisted of, along with other luggage, our bicycles packed in standard bicycle boxes. These are boxes in which bicycle manufacturers ship their new bikes all over the world. This went smoothly on the outward flight. On the return flight, however, they wanted us to sign a waiver for damage at Haneda Airport in Tokyo because the packaging was supposedly not suitable. This has never happened to me with any other airline, not even with budget airlines like Wizz-Air.
My subsequent complaint via the website was rejected three times with a standard text about bicycle transport (statement: We can take our sports baggage with us, but should register it 24 hours in advance the flight).

Jack Mars,United States,2,"Disappointing Refund Experience with Emirates Airlines: Lack of Transparency and Support""27
I would like to share my negative experience with Emirates Airlines, as I believe they are scammers. I requested a refund for my return ticket from China to Tunis, dated December 29, 2022. Despite sending several emails, I have not received any response.

Recently, I visited the Emirates Airlines office in Shanghai. The lady working there was very kind and promised to try contacting the Dubai office to process my refund. Indeed, I received an email (from a no-reply address) after 15 days stating that they had refunded me an amount of 100 Tunisian dinars, which is roughly $35.

I sent another inquiry through their website (as no email address was available), filing a complaint on November 15, 2024. I explained that I paid more than 6,300 Tunisian dinars for two one-way tickets and one return ticket.

Today, November 27, 2024, I received a system-generated email (from a no-reply address) stating the following:
“After reviewing your ticket, we found that it has already been refunded, and no further refund is due.

When I suggested purchasing my own one-way ticket and using my original return flight, they refused, stating that I must take the first flight to access the return flight. This policy felt inflexible and added unnecessary stress to an already difficult situation.

Hummings Cafe and Bar,United Kingdom,5,"leaving a young mum and 3 month baby to struggle!

Me and my wife had a baby and I wanted to treat her to a little winter sun holiday as our first trip away as a 3. I have literally been saving my amex points to be able to afford a flight to dubai with you guys, for her and the baby to be business class and for me it was economy.

We have heafrd so much about emirates as an airline so this was a big deal for us to fly with you, on our way from london to heathrow i paid for access to the lounge and the crew kindly let me help my wife into her seat so i could assist with thew baby before i made my way to economy. they also moved me to a closer seat to make sure i could go and help her off the plane also.

The flight and crew were excellent for my wife and for me, it was standard as you expect in economy. We then had our 13 day holiday… I obviously ran out of money as expected lol.

As we checked in our luggage, we asked the kind lady on the desk and her manager “do you think they will let us through as we board so i can help my wife?” and they replied “im sure they can make an exception since tyou have a new born”. we had loads more hand luggage (buying everyone the viral dubai chocolate). We walked up to the lounge as the flight was boarding, I was holding mine and my wifes hand luggage plus baby bags etc. We walked to the desk and asked agaion if it was ok if i board the plane this way so i can assist and make sure my wife is on the plane ok. she then replied “unfortunately sir we cant let you in unless you pay..” she then told me it equated to over £100. I of course asked again and reassured i wanted nothing other than to help my wife, she still refused. I even mentioned the front desk saying that it should be accepted given my circumstances and still… nothing.

Rivash R,Ireland,5,"Emirates Denies Medical Support to Passenger on Christmas Eve Despite 19 Confirmed Communications, Stranding Him and His Wife While Demanding Payment for a Refund
On Christmas Eve, Emirates Airlines showed a shocking disregard for customer care and the values they claim to represent. Despite my medical condition being fully approved in advance with 19 separate communications (which were evidenced and shown to staff) confirming their support for assistance on a long-haul flight, I was met with outright hostility and indifference at Dublin Airport.

After moving with an injury and making every preparation, I was confronted by a smug representative and his equally dismissive supervisor. Their attitudes were not only unprofessional but deeply condescending. Armed with nothing but a small printout, they bluntly informed me that they would not honor the assistance I had been promised. The evidence I brought - the painstakingly documented communications with Emirates - was completely disregarded.

It was obvious they were rehearsed in dismissing customers and determined to rush through so they could focus on their own Christmas plans. They treated me as a second-class citizen, showing no compassion, no effort to resolve the situation, and no adherence to the values of respect, generosity, and care that the UAE prides itself on.

What’s worse, they threatened to mark me as medically unfit to travel, despite me already obtaining and providing full medical clearance through their own process. This level of insensitivity and bureaucratic stonewalling is appalling.
As a result, I not only missed seeing my terminally ill grandmother, but I also lost precious time with my family during the holidays. Adding insult to injury, Emirates demanded a €600 “processing fee” just to refund the money for a service they outright denied me.

This is not just a failure of customer service - it’s an outright violation of basic decency and a disgrace to the UAE’s values of hospitality and care. Emirates markets itself as a premium airline, but my experience reveals the cold, profit-driven core underneath.

To the representatives at Dublin Airport: your smugness, lack of empathy, and eagerness to dismiss me is a stain on your brand. Emirates should take note: your actions at the Dublin office reflect poorly on your entire company and are a direct contradiction of the values you claim to uphold.

For anyone considering flying with Emirates, especially via Dublin airport, think twice. When push comes to shove, they will not care about you, your family, or your circumstances - only their bottom line. This was a disgraceful display of corporate callousness at its worst.

In other words, I cannot file a claim electronically and would only be able to do so if I go to an Emirates office/store, which requires me to spend a considerable amount of time if I want to make the claim.

Dr. Michael William Harrison,Singapore,2,"Emirates Business Class - Never again
I recently flew Emirates Airlines on a round-trip Business Class ticket from Singapore to London, connecting through Dubai. Having frequently flown with top-tier airlines like Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, ANA, and Qatar Airways, I expected the same high standard from Emirates. Unfortunately, I couldn't have been more wrong.

On my return journey from London to Singapore, I was unpleasantly surprised at check-in. I was informed that my Business Class ticket did not include access to the Business Class lounge or the car transfer service — benefits I’ve always experienced in this class, without exception, on other major airlines. When I asked why, I was curtly told by the counter staff that ""the class of ticket"" I had booked did not include these services. It was apparently buried somewhere in the ticket's terms and conditions, which, according to the assistant, I should have read thoroughly.

Let’s be clear: this was a full Business Class ticket purchased as a single booking, with no point-based upgrades or changes. Yet somehow, Emirates decided that “Business Class” for my return leg would mean fewer privileges. I have never encountered such a ridiculous arrangement. If I pay for a Business Class seat, I expect the full suite of Business Class amenities and services.

To add insult to injury, there was no amenities bag provided on the Dubai-London leg. While this might seem minor, it’s another example of the subpar experience Emirates provided at what they call “Business Class.”

For a supposedly premium airline, Emirates has missed the mark entirely. If Emirates is trying to tarnish its reputation, it’s doing an excellent job. This will be the last time I fly with them. I recommend that anyone seeking a reliable Business Class experience look elsewhere — Emirates simply isn’t worth it.",1,,emirates business class never again i recently flew emirates airlines on a round trip business class ticket from singapore to london connecting through dubai having frequently flown with top tier airlines like singapore airlines cathay pacific ana and qatar airways i expected the same high standard from emirates unfortunately i couldn t have been more wrong on my return journey from london to singapore i was unpleasantly surprised at check in i was informed that my business class ticket did not include access to the business class lounge or the car transfer service benefits i ve always experienced in this class without exception on other major airlines when i asked why i was curtly told by the counter staff that the class of ticket i had booked did not include these services it was apparently buried somewhere in the ticket s terms and conditions which according to the assistant i should have read thoroughly let s be clear this was a full business class ticket purchased as a single booking with no point based upgrades or changes yet somehow emirates decided that business class for my return leg would mean fewer privileges i have never encountered such a ridiculous arrangement if i pay for a business class seat i expect the full suite of business class amenities and services to add insult to injury there was no amenities bag provided on the dubai london leg while this might seem minor it s another example of the subpar experience emirates provided at what they call business class for a supposedly premium airline emirates has missed the mark entirely if emirates is trying to tarnish its reputation it s doing an excellent job this will be the last time i fly with them i recommend that anyone seeking a reliable business class experience look elsewhere emirates simply isn t worth it ,-0.0754,Negative,Cabin Crew
Elenka Inspired,United Kingdom,3,"Stay away from this racist organization. Disgusting airport with gross toilets
We were on a long trip back to London from Male, and had a 5-hour layover in Dubai. I last flew Emirates about 10 years ago and as a young poor student didn't mind much, but now I am appalled by the airport. It is probably one of the worst in the developed world (and some emerging markets - eg Bangalore!!). This is my fourth time flying Emirates in my life, and all four times, I - a brown woman - have been ""randomly selected"" for extra security checks, at the GATE, after scanning the boarding pass. My white partner has never been subject to the same ""courtesy"" (I even have an Emirates Skywards membership and he doesn't). When I enquired why this was necessary as everyone there had passed through security, there was no response. I asked again, and the security guard called her superior to answer. He just said ""random"" and I queried it - every person of color on my flight was selected for the check (alongside a handful of white people, though the white woman behind me had a passport from South Africa, and another white-passing woman had a Turkish passport), but it was like a scene from segregation era - all the white people queued on one side, and all the brown, Black and Asians in a makeshift ""pig pen search area"" having all their belongings strewn in public and being searched like we were criminals. The ""head"" security officer was rude to me and just barked ""random"" again. I wish I took a video of the segregation scene, but I was too shocked to think at the time. The security guard even loosened my scarf to search me. STAY AWAY from this racist company.

It was such an awful degrading experience, particularly so after a terrible experience at the airport. At 1am, the airport was FULL. Every toilet had a queue of at least 10 people, and some of the toilets only had two stalls - and because of the bidet, all toilets were disgustingly WET. In addition, there were also not enough seats for those waiting for flights, even in cafes. The outright racism was the cherry on top.",,,stay away from this racist organization disgusting airport with gross toilets we were on a long trip back to london from male and had a hour layover in dubai i last flew emirates about years ago and as a young poor student didn t mind much but now i am appalled by the airport it is probably one of the worst in the developed world and some emerging markets eg bangalore this is my fourth time flying emirates in my life and all four times i a brown woman have been randomly selected for extra security checks at the gate after scanning the boarding pass my white partner has never been subject to the same courtesy i even have an emirates skywards membership and he doesn t when i enquired why this was necessary as everyone there had passed through security there was no response i asked again and the security guard called her superior to answer he just said random and i queried it every person of color on my flight was selected for the check alongside a handful of white people though the white woman behind me had a passport from south africa and another white passing woman had a turkish passport but it was like a scene from segregation era all the white people queued on one side and all the brown black and asians in a makeshift pig pen search area having all their belongings strewn in public and being searched like we were criminals the head security officer was rude to me and just barked random again i wish i took a video of the segregation scene but i was too shocked to think at the time the security guard even loosened my scarf to search me stay away from this racist company it was such an awful degrading experience particularly so after a terrible experience at the airport at am the airport was full every toilet had a queue of at least people and some of the toilets only had two stalls and because of the bidet all toilets were disgustingly wet in addition there were also not enough seats for those waiting for flights even in cafes the outright racism was the cherry on top ,-0.9862,Negative,Comfort

How can even one know/request about this complimentary service if they don't inform you at all. Then the flight was delayed for 3 hours and one of my luggages got damaged and missing one wheel. The ticket was also expensive with only 25kg luggage allowance so I bought extra just for my luggage to be damaged. I had great experiences with Emirates growing up.

Im completely out of words how this airline went from being the best to horrible. To start with the first being is their REFUND form which you have to fill out as if you are living in 1997 before internet was a thing.

I had to request refund twice for miles separately and the cash via credit card separately.

The airline has also increased the prices significantly while being from a oil rich country lowering the skywards value for those who invested miles into their accounts trusting emirates.

Another thing I don't understand about emirates is that their family tree for miles cannot be closed and returned to an individual account incase if you do delete the family sharing account you'll lose all of those miles.

I have been flying emirates business class for 3 years on and off mostly for work. Their flight attendants have gotten worst over time.

Consumer,United Arab Emirates,1,"Racial Discrimination by Zaina!!!
I flew from London Heathrow to Dubai yesterday on the flight EK 006 .I’m giving this review a 1 star only because of the discrimination and unprofessional behaviour caused by a crew staff to my family by name ZAINA/ZAINAB. Our seating was the immediate row behind the child/infant row. Needless to say , we had to adjust a lot because of this .
Firstly , the family occupied 3 overhead lockers because of which we had to put our hand luggage 10 rows behind , which we didn’t make a fuss about .
Secondly , as soon as the family settled down they rested their seats behind throughout the flight even at the time of takeoff and during the meal time as well . I believe the seats HAS TO BE UPRIGHT DURING TAKEOFF as it is one of the safety measures .But Zaina/Zainab failed to do her duty and compromised on the safety of others, which again we never uttered a word about .

Few hours passed and when it was food time , the seats remained the same way making it highly uncomfortable for us to even have our meal .We still tried to adjust but it was getting really difficult which is when we confronted the Zaina/Zainab and requested her to inform the previous travellers to put their seat upright for atleast 10 mins of meal time .

Her reply was very unprofessional showing poor customer service .On a high note, she replied “ I can’t ask them as they have babies “. Well, we do understand they have a baby which is why we’ve been adjusting all along ,but all we asked was just 10 mins of comfortable eating .
Is this too much to ask for considering the fact that we have also paid the same amount and chosen Emirates for a reason.

She didn’t stop torturing my family , when it was sunrise she ask me to shut the window pane while all the others windows were open and were clicking pics .I paid extra for the window seat to enjoy the sunrise view but it became a total disappointment again .

She never let us enjoy or relax on the flight .She kept pestering us but it was our decency that we remained quiet .

Later we came to know that this rational behaviour of her was because she was from the same country as the previous travellers .

We’ve been frequent flyers of emirates and we always choose emirates for their customer service and flight experience.

But our flight experience was completely ruined because of the crew staff Zaina who was incharge of our sector .

However, the other factors like the smooth take off and landing , food , entertainment, prior boarding was all perfect .

What I Love About Emirates

• The check-in process in Dubai is automated, smooth, and fast, allowing me to arrive just an hour before my flight and still make it comfortably.
• Even in economy, the seats are spacious enough to feel comfortable, especially for those needing a bit more room.
• The Dubai lounge offers an impressive variety of food and drinks, along with well-designed smoking areas—a perfect place to relax before takeoff.
• Long-Haul Business and First-Class: The A380 experience is exceptional, with luxurious seating and a bar that elevates the journey.
• Consistently high-quality dining options across all classes.
• Onboard Shower in First Class, A unique, refreshing perk on select flights.
• Economy seats are comfortable, and the in-flight entertainment is always engaging.

Areas for Improvement

• Internet Connectivity: While Emirates excels in so many areas, improving the onboard internet would significantly enhance the experience, particularly for those who need to stay productive in the air.

Minesh,United Kingdom,8,"Jet Airways (an airline which went bust) with a big brand...
Well, where do I start.. An airline that actually prides themselves on being a family airline. Had high expectations travelling with Emirates and was I left hugely underwhelmed. I mostly fly with BA. They couldn't give a toss about young children. Firstly, my 5 year old child was allocated a seat by herself in another row whilst her mother, sister and dad sat another row away. Had to make numerous calls every person said I'll email the airport and we'll here back - never did. At best, the CS team were unreassuring, blaise and lacked any morale understanding of the situation and the stress this adds the the start of the holiday experience. I understand the flight was full, but this should never happen. Secondly, most airlines have small headphones for kids and an activity pack. My child was just given an empty bag on the first leg and on the second leg, we had to ask for the headphones 3 times. Staff on the second leg were grumpy and clearly lacked any basic training when dealing with people. I kindly asked for a tea where the response I got was ""wait for trolley"" which was ready to start and 50 minutes later, no tea. I approached the staff and explained what happened, credit to him, he was good, apologised and offered tea. Thirdly, snacks.. most unreputable airlines have these.. don't expect anything but the standard food. They only have there 'savoury sticks'. To me, it seems like their snack purchaser were either duped or burnt their taste buds. They offered a really old pack of digestives sitting in the back of thier draws rarely opened for emergencies. Snacks and drinks requests are just a pure drain the cabin crews.

This is a airline that puts profits over service. An airline that puts huge money into marketing their budgets but lacks the basic concept of exceptional customer service leads to more sustain business. On a positive note, the main food is pretty decent, but the lack of snacks is quite cringeworthy.
I have seen how this airline is now on a downwards trajectory. BA, who I have flown with regularly, is miles ahead of Emirates in customer care, from my experience although their food is mediocre at best.
Based on my experience, if you have a family do not fly with this airline. If you want grumpy staff, wait ages for tea, eat tasteless snack or no snacks and just a substandard experience pay for Emirates.

Charlotte Bailey,United Kingdom,2,"Worst Customer Service I've Ever Experienced
Airline lost my luggage on a flight from Glasgow to Incheon in April. Took them 5 days to return it. Customer service was beyond appalling. I was straight up l lied to on numerous occasions about the location of my luggage and when to expect it. It was eventually returned after midnight on the 5th day.
To make an insurance claim I firstly had to get a PIR number which took over a month. I then had to request a lost baggage confirmation certificate. It's supposed to take 30 days. When I spoke to customer services about this after 30 days they said it was currently taking 60 days and to 'just wait'. Spoke to them again after 60 days. This time they said they couldn't find my request and I would need to submit a new one. Another 30 days later, still no response. Its now been 97 days and I have resorted to submitting a request and a complaint every day until I receive one. Multiple complaints have all been ignored, staff on the phone have been entirely unhelpful, to the point of rudeness, with one in particular speaking fluent English until they realised I wanted to make an insurance claim and complaint, at which point they claimed they couldn't understand me. I have not spoken to a single helpful person through-out this whole experience. Requests for help have been ignored. Certificate requests have been ignored. Complaints have been ignored. And there seems to be absolutely no recourse. They can treat their customers with total contempt and nothing can be done about it. Clearly I would warn anyone against ever using this sham of an airline.

Maram AlHinai,United Kingdom,6,"Extremely Disappointing Business Class Experience on Emirates Air
I recently flew Business Class on Emirates Air from Glasgow to Phuket, and it was one of the worst experiences I've had. Despite paying £15,000 for what I thought would be a luxury experience, the reality was far from it.

Firstly, the Business Class seats were incredibly uncomfortable. I expected a level of comfort that just wasn’t there. The seat design seemed outdated and did not offer the support or space you would expect for such a long journey.

The service was equally disappointing. The cabin crew seemed uninterested and inattentive. For a 16-hour journey, we were served only two meals that tastes awful. This is unacceptable for Business Class and clearly shows that Emirates is trying to cut costs at the expense of their passengers' comfort and satisfaction.

Shockingly, despite the high ticket price, we were not given lounge access. This is something that doesn’t happen with other airlines when you purchase a Business Class ticket. It's a basic expectation for such a premium fare and a glaring oversight by Emirates.

The state of the aircraft was another major issue. It was clear that maintenance is not a priority for Emirates. The interior looked worn out and neglected, with visible signs of wear and tear. This only added to the overall uncomfortable experience.

In summary, my experience with Emirates Air Business Class was terrible. From the uncomfortable seats and poor service to the insufficient meals, lack of lounge access, and poorly maintained aircraft, it was evident that Emirates is not living up to its reputation. I will not be flying with them again and would advise others to look elsewhere for a true luxury experience.",1,,extremely disappointing business class experience on emirates air i recently flew business class on emirates air from glasgow to phuket and it was one of the worst experiences i ve had despite paying for what i thought would be a luxury experience the reality was far from it firstly the business class seats were incredibly uncomfortable i expected a level of comfort that just wasn t there the seat design seemed outdated and did not offer the support or space you would expect for such a long journey the service was equally disappointing the cabin crew seemed uninterested and inattentive for a hour journey we were served only two meals that tastes awful this is unacceptable for business class and clearly shows that emirates is trying to cut costs at the expense of their passengers comfort and satisfaction shockingly despite the high ticket price we were not given lounge access this is something that doesn t happen with other airlines when you purchase a business class ticket it s a basic expectation for such a premium fare and a glaring oversight by emirates the state of the aircraft was another major issue it was clear that maintenance is not a priority for emirates the interior looked worn out and neglected with visible signs of wear and tear this only added to the overall uncomfortable experience in summary my experience with emirates air business class was terrible from the uncomfortable seats and poor service to the insufficient meals lack of lounge access and poorly maintained aircraft it was evident that emirates is not living up to its reputation i will not be flying with them again and would advise others to look elsewhere for a true luxury experience ,-0.9799,Negative,Cabin Crew

Amalia,Switzerland,1,"Worst Airline & customer service
I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with the incredibly poor customer service I experienced with Emirates Airline. My journey with your airline has been nothing short of a nightmare, and I am compelled to share my experience.

In April, my flight was suddenly canceled, and despite my efforts to get in touch, there was no refund issued, nor did I receive any form of apology. I was left to cover all the associated costs myself, which is completely unacceptable.

As if this wasn’t enough, my return flight was equally disappointing. My luggage was damaged during the flight, and even though I reported it, I never received any response or apology. It’s astonishing that an airline of your reputation would treat its customers with such disregard.

The in-flight service was abysmal. Despite having pre-ordered vegetarian meals( my partner and me)for both outbound and return flights, there were not enough available, and all I was offered were some crackers. The cabin crew’s attitude was also highly unprofessional and unfriendly, a stark contrast to the level of service I remember from ten years ago. The decline in service quality is shocking, and it’s clear that Emirates is no longer the premium airline it once was.

In summary, I am extremely disappointed with my experience. The level of customer service has plummeted, and I can no longer recommend Emirates to anyone.

Aleya Ramparsad Banwari,South Africa,1,"Appalling Special Assistance Service - Nearly Missed Two Flights
Our experience with Emirates and their ""Special Assistance"" service at Dubai Airport was an absolute nightmare. Travelling with my elderly grandmother, who requires a wheelchair due to limited mobility, turned into a physically and emotionally distressing ordeal.

On both 21 October 2024 (Dubai to Bali) and 29 October 2024 (Dubai to Johannesburg), we were abandoned without the pre-booked wheelchair assistance we desperately needed. Despite repeatedly requesting help, the staff ignored and dismissed us. This negligence caused us to nearly miss both flights, leaving us rushed, panicked, and scrambling to make it on time.

The situation was worsened by the behaviour of an employee named ""Grupan."" His unprofessionalism, rudeness, and sexist attitude toward female passengers and colleagues were appalling. Instead of helping, he argued with me and dismissed our valid concerns. My grandmother was ultimately forced to walk long distances to the aircraft, which caused her significant pain and distress that lasted for several days.

The staff's sheer indifference is staggering. The expectation that a passenger with limited mobility should walk hundreds of meters to the aircraft entrance completely defeats the purpose of booking assistance. Emirates' approach to accessibility is not only negligent but outright dehumanizing.

Their response to my formal complaint was equally disheartening. Offering 10,000 Skywards Miles as a “gesture of goodwill” felt like an insult. They failed to provide any transparency about their actions to ensure this does not happen again. This experience has left me with no confidence in Emirates' ability to care for its passengers, especially those with special needs.

If I ever have to fly Emirates again—which is highly unlikely—I will bring my own wheelchair because their service cannot be trusted. For an airline that markets itself as a leader in luxury and quality, this experience was nothing short of disgraceful. Avoid Emirates if you or a loved one need any kind of assistance—they are unreliable, negligent, and dehumanising.

Flying business class with Emirates for the first time was a revelation—a reminder of how air travel can still feel like an experience, rather than just a means to a destination. From start to finish, Emirates truly lived up to its reputation for excellence.

The Emirates Experience: Stepping on board, I was warmly greeted by the crew, whose attentiveness and professionalism set the tone for the entire flight. The cabin was immaculate, with every detail crafted for luxury and comfort. Emirates’ business class truly feels like a return to the elegance of a bygone era of flying, where the journey itself is an occasion.

The Seat and Cabin: The seat was spacious, adjustable to a fully flat bed, and designed to maximize privacy and convenience. There was ample space for everything I needed, including a large entertainment screen with an impressive selection of movies, TV shows, and more. It felt like a private retreat at 35,000 feet.

Dining Onboard: The food was nothing short of exceptional. The multi-course menu featured beautifully presented, gourmet-quality dishes that could easily rival a fine dining restaurant. Every meal was accompanied by an impressive selection of wines and champagne, thoughtfully curated to match the cuisine. Even the smallest details, like the freshly baked bread and signature Arabic coffee with dates, made the meal feel special.

Service Excellence: The Emirates crew went above and beyond, attentive without being intrusive, always ensuring that every need was met. They seemed genuinely passionate about creating a memorable experience for passengers. This level of personal care and commitment to quality is rare in modern air travel.

In Summary: My first flight in Emirates business class was a journey I’ll never forget. From the incredible food to the luxurious, well-appointed cabin and stellar staff, every moment felt like a celebration of the joy of travel. Emirates has set the bar high, and it’s easy to see why they’re celebrated worldwide.

neo boonya,Thailand,2,"Terrible customer service for delayed baggage
I am slightly annoyed at the airline for a couple of reasons. One of my luggage’s got delayed and I believe that delaying luggage is quite common on emirates airline from all my friends having the same experience. Another reason I am quite annoyed is their compensation is terrible. Lastly and this is the most annoying reason is their customer service they act as if it’s not their fault as if it is a common thing and for some reason their customer service for delayed luggage is not 24/7 as well as if they don’t realise how important someone’s luggage is to them. And if you are wondering yes about 10 other people were also having this problem at the luggage inquiry station. I would also like to say that they did not contact me a single time during the whole situation so I had to constantly call customer support which left me on hold for more than an hour and was not even helping me. From the research that I had done this issue usually occurs with connecting flights that includes Dubai airport as a connecting point as sometimes the baggage loading and unloading team don’t do it fast enough so they have to send it through a different flight. Absolutely disappointing from such a prestigious airline.

Update: After days of waiting the baggage finally arrived at my hotel. My opinion on the situation has not changed one bit and has gotten worse because my friends baggage also got delayed on their flight yesterday. It’s clearly not uncommon even customer support makes it feel like it happens every single flight.

I have been a loyal Emirates Airlines customer for quite some time, but after my recent experience, I can no longer recommend your airline to anyone.

However, when I arrived at the airport the next day, the system showed no record of any extra luggage. Despite the floor staff's efforts to resolve the issue, they were unable to find any additional baggage allowance under my name. As a result, I was forced to pay an additional AED 4500 at the airport just to catch my flight. I immediately contacted Emirates in Dubai, and they promised to investigate, as the conversation was recorded. However, when I followed up with the Nice office, I was met with rudeness, and the representative even hung up on me. Another representative then informed me that I would have to wait up to 60 days for a response. In total, I was charged twice for extra baggage, amounting to AED 6160, on top of the ticket price. As a student who came to Nice, these unexpected charges have put me in a difficult financial situation. I am deeply disappointed by the disorganization and lack of customer care I experienced.

I had a night night stay booked with you to Mauritius, I phoned you call centre to enquire about cost to amend my booking to either a 12 night stay or a 14 night stay.
The phone lines at Emirates were problematic yesterday and the advisers had openly admitted that they had had some complaints regarding them.When connected to the First Lady she asked if she could phone me back when she had researched the difference in price.I suggested she email me and I would ring in if I wanted to accept the change and proceed.After a couple of hours I had not received anything back in my email from Emirates. I phoned back and got a different gentleman who contacted the original person tasked with this request, he informed me she had been really busy with other customers and would get it over to me shortly. A short while later the lady rang me and asked if she could do it the next day as she had been busy with other customers, I objected stating I was a customer who had already been on the phone and I expect her to finish with my request, she agreed and about twenty mins later I received the quote. I phoned up emirates about 15 mins later to accept and book but got a different call handler, they said they could not get a price the same as original call handler and it was another £3000 extra on top of what I had just been quoted.The call handler said he would message her and get her to ring me back the next day. Around 9.30am the next day I again called as nobody had contacted me.Another call handler listened to my predicament and after a lot of other calls came back with another quote this time about £1000 higher than the original. I asked them to honour the emailed quote which he refused. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was put on hold twice to wait for a supervisor but he was busy. I said I would like to completely cancel my booking with an understanding that I would lose my £302 deposit.The whole experience from dysfunctional internet phone lines to been cut off, put on hold and then at the end of it not getting the quoted price 20 mins after receiving it has left me absolutely stressed out and most of all disappointed in a company as 5star as Emirates proclaims.

Flight from London Heathrow to Dubai then Dubai to Johannesburg then Jo'burg to Skukusa. We checked luggage in at Heathrow and specifically asked Emirates staff to confirm that the luggage was checked all the way through to Skukusa. Two different staff members confirmed this. We had upgraded our seats to extra legroom in economy flex at an additional cost. First flight was late leaving Heathrow by an hour which put huge pressure on the connection at Dubai. We had boarding cards for the second flight but when we got to Dubai we were given 3 new ones splitting our family group around the plane and without our extra legroom seats. Once I complained, and our original seats were empty! we were eventually moved back into what we paid for. We arrived at Jo'burg in time for our Skukusa connection only to be told we weren't on that flight anymore but had been bumped to the next day. Another massive complaint session, along with an explanation that our destination resort was £3000 a night, so the compensation claim was going to be huge persuaded them to get us back onto the original flight , in the same seats .We made our transfer pick up but our luggage didn't. None of it, 3 large cases, we only had what we stood in. Lost luggage claim started at Skukusa. No communication or assistance from Emirates. Next day they told us they'd found 2 of the 3 cases and they were coming from Jo'burg to Skukusa on the next flight, guaranteed, but they didn't know where the 3rd case was and we'd have to collect the cases from Skukusa, 2 hours away from our safari lodge hotel. The lodge were great but said we'd have to pay for the collection, fair enough. We had to buy clothes for 3 people from the lodge shop as we only had travel clothes we'd been in for 3 days. The cases didn't arrive as guaranteed by Emirates and we incurred a collection charge for nothing. No communication from Emirates. I was chasing hourly for info and just getting nothing back . The third day our lodge got a message saying 2 cases arrived in Skukusa and that a third was coming later the same day so rather than additional transfer costs they waited for all the cases to be confirmed as having arrived as they didn't trust Emirates information either! Eventually after 3 days and lots of stress we had 3 cases and a large bill for additional clothes, toiletries and laundry ( we couldn't buy underwear so had to launder clothing) as well as pick up costs. 5 days later Emirates have got a formal complaint with a request for reimbursement for costs. Not heard anything from them yet apologising, or advising how to submit my claim for costs and compensation. I have flown with many airlines over the last 55 years, never have I been treated with such contempt, like I'm doing them a favour. The service from Emirates is diabolical, unacceptable and completely inadequate. If zero stars were an option I'd give it. Hopefully they will read this, reach out and put things right. I will then happily upgrade my review.",1,8/7/2024,the first and last time i used this airline the first question from trustpilot is what went wrong my answer is what didn t flight from london heathrow to dubai then dubai to johannesburg then jo burg to skukusa we checked luggage in at heathrow and specifically asked emirates staff to confirm that the luggage was checked all the way through to skukusa two different staff members confirmed this we had upgraded our seats to extra legroom in economy flex at an additional cost first flight was late leaving heathrow by an hour which put huge pressure on the connection at dubai we had boarding cards for the second flight but when we got to dubai we were given new ones splitting our family group around the plane and without our extra legroom seats once i complained and our original seats were empty we were eventually moved back into what we paid for we arrived at jo burg in time for our skukusa connection only to be told we weren t on that flight anymore but had been bumped to the next day another massive complaint session along with an explanation that our destination resort was a night so the compensation claim was going to be huge persuaded them to get us back onto the original flight in the same seats we made our transfer pick up but our luggage didn t none of it large cases we only had what we stood in lost luggage claim started at skukusa no communication or assistance from emirates next day they told us they d found of the cases and they were coming from jo burg to skukusa on the next flight guaranteed but they didn t know where the rd case was and we d have to collect the cases from skukusa hours away from our safari lodge hotel the lodge were great but said we d have to pay for the collection fair enough we had to buy clothes for people from the lodge shop as we only had travel clothes we d been in for days the cases didn t arrive as guaranteed by emirates and we incurred a collection charge for nothing no communication from emirates i was chasing hourly for info and just getting nothing back the third day our lodge got a message saying cases arrived in skukusa and that a third was coming later the same day so rather than additional transfer costs they waited for all the cases to be confirmed as having arrived as they didn t trust emirates information either eventually after days and lots of stress we had cases and a large bill for additional clothes toiletries and laundry we couldn t buy underwear so had to launder clothing as well as pick up costs days later emirates have got a formal complaint with a request for reimbursement for costs not heard anything from them yet apologising or advising how to submit my claim for costs and compensation i have flown with many airlines over the last years never have i been treated with such contempt like i m doing them a favour the service from emirates is diabolical unacceptable and completely inadequate if zero stars were an option i d give it hopefully they will read this reach out and put things right i will then happily upgrade my review ,0.809,Positive,Cabin Crew
Naveed,United Kingdom,20,"Travelling with Emirates....a nightmare
I travelled from Birmingham to Multan, Pakistan on 10th August 2024 using emirates as our airline, a family of 5 including 2 children. Flight was supposed to fly at 14:35 but it was delayed for 5 hours and took off after 7 pm. I had a connecting flight from Dubai to Multan and the person at Birmingham airport printed only Birmingham to Dubai boarding passes. When I insisted on my connecting flight boarding passes, he assured me they would be ready and available at the connections desk in Dubai airport; such a dishonest person.
Our connecting flight was at 6:35 am and we landed at 4:30 am on Dubai airport. We rushed to the connection counter near B 18 gate to pick up our boarding passes for our next flight, pushing our sleepy kids. The connection counter was crowded, and when our turn came, the staff did not show any sympathy and refused to print our boarding passes. They said they did not have access to printing boarding passes, and since this is a fly Dubai flight, we should go to terminal 2 to print our boarding passes. I begged ticket counter staff next to connection counter to print boarding passes to save our flight but they said this not our job.
We landed at Terminal 3 and our next flight was at Terminal 2 so we ran towards bus terminal to get a bus for Terminal 2 without our boarding passes. While waiting for bus for terminal 2 transfer, I requested a guy at Emirates reception desk to print out our boarding passes and he helped us and explained that without printing these boarding passes, you might have lost your flight while transferring to terminal 2 because your flight had only 1 hour left to take off. He was the only person during our journey who was a real human being.
While we were pleased to have made our flight, but another problem awaited us when our luggage did not arrive. After 36 hours of the flight landing, our five bags are still missing, and our family of five with two children has nothing to maintain our daily life.
I launched a complaint at airport for our lost Luggage (MUXFZ 19563) and we were advised to contact emirates and fly Dubai offices. There is no emirates office in Multan, Pakistan and flydubai office at Multan said that they are not the concerned people. After contacting fly Dubai UAN, they gave me an email address to file a complaint, and I also launched a complaint online (case ID 14267286), got a response that they would get back to me within 96 hours.
Still I am without my luggage and emirates have ruined my holidays. Emirates treat you according to your passport of origin, probably an airline for elites. It does not seem like an easy process to claim IR since I lost luggage and I had a flight delay, so I may need a solicitor for the process since it does not appear to be an easy one with Emirates.",1,8/10/2024,travelling with emirates a nightmare i travelled from birmingham to multan pakistan on th august using emirates as our airline a family of including children flight was supposed to fly at but it was delayed for hours and took off after pm i had a connecting flight from dubai to multan and the person at birmingham airport printed only birmingham to dubai boarding passes when i insisted on my connecting flight boarding passes he assured me they would be ready and available at the connections desk in dubai airport such a dishonest person our connecting flight was at am and we landed at am on dubai airport we rushed to the connection counter near b gate to pick up our boarding passes for our next flight pushing our sleepy kids the connection counter was crowded and when our turn came the staff did not show any sympathy and refused to print our boarding passes they said they did not have access to printing boarding passes and since this is a fly dubai flight we should go to terminal to print our boarding passes i begged ticket counter staff next to connection counter to print boarding passes to save our flight but they said this not our job we landed at terminal and our next flight was at terminal so we ran towards bus terminal to get a bus for terminal without our boarding passes while waiting for bus for terminal transfer i requested a guy at emirates reception desk to print out our boarding passes and he helped us and explained that without printing these boarding passes you might have lost your flight while transferring to terminal because your flight had only hour left to take off he was the only person during our journey who was a real human being while we were pleased to have made our flight but another problem awaited us when our luggage did not arrive after hours of the flight landing our five bags are still missing and our family of five with two children has nothing to maintain our daily life i launched a complaint at airport for our lost luggage muxfz and we were advised to contact emirates and fly dubai offices there is no emirates office in multan pakistan and flydubai office at multan said that they are not the concerned people after contacting fly dubai uan they gave me an email address to file a complaint and i also launched a complaint online case id got a response that they would get back to me within hours still i am without my luggage and emirates have ruined my holidays emirates treat you according to your passport of origin probably an airline for elites it does not seem like an easy process to claim ir since i lost luggage and i had a flight delay so i may need a solicitor for the process since it does not appear to be an easy one with emirates ,-0.9369,Negative,Cabin Crew

Chris Mitchell,United Kingdom,36,"Scale has turned Emirates into a 3rd-Rate Airline
In 40 years of Air Travel that ran through Charters to Premium Airlines, I can honestly say, I have watched Emirates Airlines deteriorate into a 3rd-rate airline.
From 2007-2012, they were undoubtedly among the very best Long Haul Airlines in the World; particularly shining for Cabin Service.
I do recall in 2009, being bumped from my connecting flight to Pakistan in Dubai, for an Emirati customer; and then abandoned for 24 hours without so much as a refreshment; but hey - we kind of expect and tolerate that kind of thing in the Arabian Peninsula; and nevertheless - in all other facets, they were exceptional.
Sadly, that badge of excellence is gone now. My recent 20 hour return flight to Mauritius on Emirates via Dubai was quite simply, an airline ordeal I won't ever forget.
Having checked in as soon as the check in desks opened at #BHX - I then spent 3 hours in a security line, before immediately boarding the waiting Airbus A380 to Dubai.
With 13 Cabin Crew in the Economy Section alone, it was nevertheless nearly 2 and a half hours before I managed to get a glass of water. And that was only because my travel companion made a fuss due to recognising I was in distress. Even then, the Stewardess, who had completely ignored both button calls and verbal requests for assistance, brusquely told us we would have to wait for the meal service.
It should have been easy for me to get up and help myself to a cup of water but on all 4 flights, the seatbelt lights stayed on for nearly 3 hours, despite their being no turbulence whatsoever.
On the second leg of the return flight, confined to a seat for 2 hours without turbulence, I could wait no more to use the toilet (about 2 meters away) but was told to 'sit-down' by a male steward; when I asked why the seatbelt signs were on and explained I needed a bathroom break I was effectively ignored; so I responded in kind and asked if they would prefer I urinate in my seat; at which point they told me I could use the toilet but at my own risk. Strangely enough when I exited the toilet there was a queue of similarly minded people and some seriously upset cabin crew giving them evil looks.
It seems that as a cost-cutting measure, Emirates now routinely confine their customers to their seats for as much as the flight as they can justify; their is no drinks service; only a single drink served with the food-service and beyond that, any notion of customer service is now gone.
In truth, I had a better experience with Holiday Charter Airlines in the 1980's and with low-cost airlines in the last 20 years.
'You pay for what you get' is simply not true. Jet2, Ryanair, EasyJet, Thomson Fly and others charge very little for the basic flight and then extort customers for tepid-water, a teabag and a smile; Emirates extort you for the entire flight, minus a teabag or smile...",1,6/5/2024,scale has turned emirates into a rd rate airline in years of air travel that ran through charters to premium airlines i can honestly say i have watched emirates airlines deteriorate into a rd rate airline from they were undoubtedly among the very best long haul airlines in the world particularly shining for cabin service i do recall in being bumped from my connecting flight to pakistan in dubai for an emirati customer and then abandoned for hours without so much as a refreshment but hey we kind of expect and tolerate that kind of thing in the arabian peninsula and nevertheless in all other facets they were exceptional sadly that badge of excellence is gone now my recent hour return flight to mauritius on emirates via dubai was quite simply an airline ordeal i won t ever forget having checked in as soon as the check in desks opened at bhx i then spent hours in a security line before immediately boarding the waiting airbus a to dubai with cabin crew in the economy section alone it was nevertheless nearly and a half hours before i managed to get a glass of water and that was only because my travel companion made a fuss due to recognising i was in distress even then the stewardess who had completely ignored both button calls and verbal requests for assistance brusquely told us we would have to wait for the meal service it should have been easy for me to get up and help myself to a cup of water but on all flights the seatbelt lights stayed on for nearly hours despite their being no turbulence whatsoever on the second leg of the return flight confined to a seat for hours without turbulence i could wait no more to use the toilet about meters away but was told to sit down by a male steward when i asked why the seatbelt signs were on and explained i needed a bathroom break i was effectively ignored so i responded in kind and asked if they would prefer i urinate in my seat at which point they told me i could use the toilet but at my own risk strangely enough when i exited the toilet there was a queue of similarly minded people and some seriously upset cabin crew giving them evil looks it seems that as a cost cutting measure emirates now routinely confine their customers to their seats for as much as the flight as they can justify their is no drinks service only a single drink served with the food service and beyond that any notion of customer service is now gone in truth i had a better experience with holiday charter airlines in the s and with low cost airlines in the last years you pay for what you get is simply not true jet ryanair easyjet thomson fly and others charge very little for the basic flight and then extort customers for tepid water a teabag and a smile emirates extort you for the entire flight minus a teabag or smile ,0.8642,Positive,Cabin Crew

ARE EMIRATES’ AIRMILES A CON?
My wife and I have been loyal customers of Emirates Airlines for more than 15 years. We have amassed many thousands of Emirates Airmiles. However, we have concluded their Airmiles Scheme is a Con.
We have travelled with Emirates many times in Business and First Class to Australia and the Far East and back to Manchester and spent well over £30,000 with them and have earned many thousands of Airmiles. We regularly receive emails from Emirates telling us how valuable our Airmiles are and how they can be used when booking our next flight. They say our Airmiles have been upgraded to Silver Standard.
However, whenever we’ve booked new flights and tried to apply our Airmiles, Emirates would not allow us to use them. This is according to the Travel Agents. In February 2024, we booked our flights directly with Emirates ourselves. These were for BUSINESS CLASS seats to Hong Kong, returning to Manchester from Shanghai. When booking these directly by phone, we asked Emirates to use our Airmiles. He said he’d credited them to our tickets. When our tickets arrived, we discovered the Ticketing Agent had lied and, once again, Emirates had not credited the Airmiles to our tickets. We then complained. Our booking phone conversation was listened to by an Emirates Manager and she confirmed we had asked for our Airmiles to be credited and their Ticketing Agent had said he’d applied them to our tickets. However, she then said, we would not be able to complain further or ask for any compensation until we had taken the flights.
Since returning, we have sent many letters to the Emirates Complaints Portal. They reply only to say they will not offer us any monetary compensation. They added insult to injury, by offering us 15,000 extra Airmiles, which we knew would be valueless.
Additionally, when we were booking our last flight, we asked for Direct Flights and were told they were, but when taking the flight to Hong Kong we found we were being diverted to call in at Bangkok. There, we had to sit on the runway for over 2 hours while Airport Workers scurried around us cleaning the aircraft cabin.
After many letters of complaint, Emirates say they will not offer any compensation and our Case in now closed.

Having recently suffered truly terrible service from BA, and deciding never to fly with them again, we booked with Emirates for a trip from London to Dubai. We have flown with Emirates a number of times over the years and have never had a problem.
This time was no exception, in fact I felt that I should post here on Trustpilot to say how good the flights were, as most postings are, by nature, usually negative.
We travelled out of Gatwick on the 29.5.24 at 21.45 on Flight No.EK010, as a family of six with two young children. The flight was probably the best I have had for years! The cabin crew, particularly Marko and Mohamed were amazing, true professionals who were simply excellent at their jobs. I will remember their care and kindness for ever.
We returned on the 4.6.24 at 14.55 on flight No.EK009. Our seats were in economy on the upper deck of the aircraft. This flight could not have been more different to the outbound flight through no fault of Emirates. The problem was a particularly difficult and ignorant family sitting just in front of us.

A very bad customer service. We had bought twin seats for one part of our journey. At some point we wanted to upgrade to business class, realised I was using the wrong credit card and tried to go back to edit card details. They locked me out from trying to upgrade, when contacting them they said they can upgrade only over the phone, so I should call to make the payment over the phone. Had no roaming at the time, and did not want to purchase it for one day left of our holiday, tried to do it over whatsapp but they said it can only be done over the phone.
That wasn't actually why I left a one star review, it is actually for the fact that they had sold our twin tickets to somebody else and had given us random seats. When trying to sort it out on our way home we were told to try and sort it in Dubai (our stop over), which we did. One lady tried to help us, talked to her supervisor, and she said that he wasn't even interested into looking into the problem for us. At the gate we managed to get seats together and we were told to complain on the website. We asked for a refund and the answer was a ""no"" with a link to terms and conditions. So basically, they sold our seats to someone else, and now we were not entitled to a refund, with no actual reason stated to why.

Willy,South Africa,1,"Incompetent staff
To all the staff at Emirates , the staff on the ground to the staff in their offices , that have no idea what is going on and do not care about the passengers
My husband and i celebrated our 50th wedding anniversary last year , instead of having a party , we decided to go on a trip to Italy and Croatia . This was a dream come true for us and we spent months planning our trip , organising places to stay and visit.
We understand that there was flooding in Dubai and this was something that could not have been foreseen. But the way the situation was handled was shocking..
When we arrived in Dubai there was chaos and incompetent staff who had no idea on how to handle the situation.
We were told to wait for our connecting flight to Rome , which eventually got cancelled . We then had to go and change . We had to stand in mass of people all fighting to get to the front of the queue. There was no crowd control or enough staff to attend to the masses . We stood in the queue for 7 hours waiting for a new boarding pass for the following morning. Again we had to wait the entire day to board a flight and again at the end of the day the flight got cancelled . Again we had to go and change our boarding passes , standing in the mass of people for hours.
We eventually got onto a plane to Rome on Friday afternoon , when we arrived in Rome all our bags were missing . The staff there told us we would have our bags within 24 hours ( we got our bags back when we got back home 3 weeks later.
The whole experience of flying with Emirates was terrible.
Staff were incompetent, uncaring and had no clue as to what was going on .
When we were at Dubai airport there was a lacking of seating , we had to sit /sleep on the floor , at our age this put strain on our health.
Most of the restaurants ran out of food .
We had to buy clothing and toiletries along the way , which had not budgeted for .
My husband got extremely ill and we had to buy medication for him , another expense incurred.
With not having a suitcase we could not buy gifts for the grandchildren . Because we also had to carry our clothes and toiletries .
Our friends that traveled with us spent many hours emailing and making phone calls to try and track the suitcases
At no stage did Emirates offer an apology or offer any compensation for the extra costs we incurred.

We recently took a trip to visit my son in Vietnam for the first time since he moved there last year.
We had never flown long haul before but as Emirates had the best reputation for their customers we decided to book our flights with them.
We flew from Glasgow-Dubai on 17th April. We already had a delayed flight going out there but was assured everything was fine.
After getting to Dubai we were again assured before we got off the aircraft that our connecting flight would be waiting for us and just to head to Connections and they would point us in the right direction.
What we walked in to was absolute chaos!!
People sleeping on the floors, no queueing system and staff that quite frankly couldn’t care less!!
We were in a so called queue, people pushing and shoving for over 20 hours before we could get a new boarding pass.
Any available staff ignored us. One even laughed in someone’s face when they asked how much longer they would need to wait. There was absolutely no reassurance or information given to us.
No food, no sleep, and when we finally made it to Hanoi nearly 3 days later we were so exhausted and shaken up that it made us anxious the whole holiday knowing we would have to make the return journey.
My partner received his luggage 4 days into our holiday broken and missing a wheel (we have since had to throw it away) while I had to wait 7 days for mine.
Our son was getting married on the 20th April and we made it with only a few hours to spare, also had to borrow clothes to attend which wasn’t ideal but we were just grateful to be there.

Hours into the flight we’d had no response to our request so I asked the same flight attendant what was the outcome of the request and she said there were no places to move to but hadn’t been and explained this so I asked to speak to the flight manager.

Just recently landed Friday 19 th April having flown from London Heathrow to Mauritius .
Sincerely impressed by Emirates - have to say had two beautifully run flights - whilst the staff must have been under significant pressure due to obvious logistics, given the rain storm, flight rescheduling, and additional longer hours and less crew available - they all did a brilliant and extremely professional job.
The airport was under pressure, as was seen on reports however Emirates accommodated travellers with notified free food outlet options for all travellers which was a helpful solution.

Even though we were seriously delayed due to the onward connection, as there were cancellations Emirates did incredibly well.

Streugut,Germany,1,"I‘m still traumatized about what…
I‘m still traumatized about what happened to me and my family at the airport of Dubai.
I try to keep it short, but specific. It starts with the main mistake: You (Emirates) flew us with 4 hours delay for 9 hours on the 17.04. from Manila to Dubai, knowing what was going on at the airport in Dubai. The mess was still running for a day. So my wife, my son (4y), my daughter (2y) and myself were sent to a place of chaos, without any support (especially for people in need). You couldn‘t care less!
Usually we had to spend 2-3hours as transits at the airport. It went out that it were over 24hours of torture for all of us. After an disgraceful way to the cancellation of our flights we had to go to the wall of people waiting for any answers. Some of them were 12 hours in the queue still waiting.
The only way for us was to wait as well. With two little kids in the middle of tired, sad and desperate people. After two hours in the line (We were awake and struggling for almost 24hours at that time)we were rushly taken out of queue with the promise that we will be handled prioritized as well as older people around us. We gave our passports in the hand of an Emirates employee in the hope of a faster solution. After 3 hours of waiting, asking, hoping, begging, another employee came back with our passports and the passports of the elderly people next to us. The result: nothing! They didn‘t hand out our passports to people in charge. They were just on any desk with no attention of everyone.
We were completely shocked and desperate. 3 hours waiting for nothing, both kids standing in front of a stinky, destroyed toilet for disabled people. So we had to wait for another 6 1/2 hours. I begged and begged and begged to 2 security guards to help us. After nearly 9 hours someone came and give us a piece of paper (not a ticket) with a kind of reservation for a flight to Hamburg/Bremen on the 23rd (6 days later!!!!). At that point my wife and I were awake for nearly 40 hours!!! So no flight, no place to sleep, no food support - nothing at all. We went to the Business Class Lounge to get any help. - They treated us like animals and sent us away (There was enough space for us 4!!).
We were so sad, couldn‘t believe what happened!! We extra booked our holiday flights with Emirates, because we thought that this company would take care of our family, especially of the children, in any situation!!! But the result was a complete nightmare. After we were sent away from your „desk of the rich“, we had to spend a fortune for food that was left over at the airport (5$ for a water says it all).
In our despair we went to every gate that showed destinations in Germany. Still with both kids, hand luggage and no sleep. I was begging and almost crying to your employees to get us on a plane. Finally we could manage it to a very delayed plane to Hamburg. A lot of other people didn’t get it and were send away again. The sad thing - there were so many free seats left on the plane. The whole first class was free! People could have gone out with that plane. But they were not allowed. Same for us before for a lot of times.
At the end we are so relieved to be home. We were all in tears when we came back. 50 hours of no sleep. Almost impossible and we are still sick today. We are waiting for our luggage as well.
All in all, the „flood“ wasn‘t the problem. It was the communication and the behavior to treat our little family as animals!

Mandy Louise Woodcock,United Kingdom,18,"Outrageous customer care service
My cousin recently travelled from Australia via Dubai to the UK before heading on to Budapest for a river cruise to Amsterdam, a trip
Of a life time. My cousin arrived at Birmingham airport last Thursdays morning after 24 hour delay in Dubai to find no Luggage. Having tried for days, no answered phone, no email reply or able to online chat we went to Birmingham airport on Sunday morning to try and get answers they needed. We established eventually luggage was still in Dubai and will be for some time. Even when the luggage arrives in Birmingham it will take time to process due to limited staff in customs. Shopping trip needed so my cousin could at least enjoy their cruise. Shopping in Shirley & Solihull for 2 people on a 2 week cruise in just a few hours is a challenge. Buying everything from shoes, underwear, toiletries, full outfits & costing a fortune, challenge accomplished. My cousin’s experience has been a night mare after packing in Australia for some time for this trip of a life time. On top of this my cousin immigrated to Australian 56 years ago so this would have been our first meeting face to face. In stead of having an amazing time doing amazing things thanks to emirates our time was spent shopping and trying to get answers. I’m extremely disappointed with the airline which I have always perceived to be world class. We met a couple at Birmingham airport who were in a similar situation to my cousin who had traveled from Vietnam their flight had been diverted to London so they had to get a flight to Birmingham to pick up their car. The woman was so very upset I cried with her after hearing their experience. Since, I have spoken to a friend today who had same experience, a trip of a life time to Vietnam ruined a few months ago again luggage did not arrive this was well before Dubai weather conditions. Although I appreciate the problems in Dubai last week with unforeseen weather circumstances there are far too many unhappy customers. Emirates you really need to sort your logistics out as this is causing a lot of unhappiness for many customers who pay you well to give them experience they will never forget.

Mr Peter singh,United Kingdom,28,"Very poor service received
I was due to travel on the 18th April from DXB/Dubai back to Manchester with my family, what a disaster from Emirates and the Airport staff.

I totally understand the flood issues which happened on Tuesday 16th of April, however we were not due to fly until Thursday 2:30pm.

The minute we entered the airport it was absolute chaos with passengers everywhere no communication or system in place for anything, no one to speak to get any advice or support.

We had no choice but to sit on the floor as there was no where to sit. We were given 1 meal voucher in the 10 hour we waited which was sent by email, which we used in McDonalds, even this was subsidised to a (child size meal), nothing else was offered in time we waited, so we paid £25 each for access to airport lounges.
A total of 14 hours in the Airport!

We felt very frustrated as there was no Emirates Staff in sight. Failing to provide care of to their own customers, leaving them stranded in the airport. Runways were clear from flooding, the only information we were given by airport staff is they are having technical issues.

I really hope Emirates have learned from this as I am a frequent traveler with this airline.

Hamed Gharibi,Denmark,1,"Bad Airline
Listen up, because I’ve got a bone to pick with the entire airline industry! 😡

So there I was, innocently booking my flight from Tehran (IKA) to Dubai. You’d think it’d be a straightforward journey, right? Wrong! The flight from Tehran decided to play hide-and-seek with time, delaying itself by a whopping 30 to 40 minutes. And what’s my reward for patiently waiting? A measly 1 hour and 20 minutes for my stopover in Dubai.

But oh no, the drama doesn’t end there! Was the flight canceled? Were we late? Who knows! The airline, in all its infinite wisdom, decided to reschedule us for the next day—yes, you heard me right, the next day! So there I was, stranded in Dubai, twiddling my thumbs, waiting for the 20th of April like it was some grand event. 🙄

Now, brace yourselves for the pièce de résistance: the flight from Dubai to Vienna, and then from Vienna to Copenhagen. Another stopover, this time a mere 1 hour and 5 minutes. But guess what? The first flight, true to form, decided to channel its inner sloth and delay itself by 30 more precious minutes. Passport control? Oh, don’t even get me started! I stood in that queue longer than it takes to binge-watch an entire season of a Netflix series. And what do I get for my troubles? A missed flight to Copenhagen! 🤬

So, what’s a weary traveler to do? Spend the night in the airport with my friend's parents which they age +80 years old , of course! Because nothing says “luxury vacation” like a cold, hard airport bench.
First, they shuffled me off to Austria like a deck of cards. Why? Who knows! Maybe they thought I needed a scenic detour through the Alps. But let me tell you, my knees weren’t thrilled about this unexpected European adventure. The space between those chairs was tighter than a corset at a Victorian ball. 🦵

And let’s talk about the “Bad plans” they swapped me onto. I didn’t sign up for this! If I wanted a cramped seat, I’d have taken the bus. But no, I was promised luxury, and all I got was a sore back and a grumpy attitude. 😤

So there I was, stranded in Vienna airport overnight, my pockets lighter and my patience thinner than a wafer. Why, you ask? Because apparently, the airline’s idea of hospitality is “pay up or freeze.” Yep, I had to dig into my own pocket to buy food and essentials. No vouchers, no warm blankets—just a cold, hard reality check that airlines don’t care about our comfort. 🥶

But wait, it gets worse! Remember my friend’s elderly parents? The ones who’ve seen more winters than the airport’s HVAC system? Well, they were in the same boat (or should I say, frosty airplane hangar). Eighty years old, shivering, and probably regretting their life choices—just like the rest of us. 🥶

And let’s talk about the wheelchair debacle. We asked for help, pleaded for assistance, but the airport staff were as elusive as unicorns. No wheelchairs magically appeared. So, my friend’s parents had to navigate the airport like Olympic sprinters. Off the plane, into the passport control queue, and then a mad dash to catch the next flight. Spoiler alert: We missed it. 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️

And let’s not forget the pièce de résistance part deux: my lost luggage. Yep, my bags decided to take a detour to Narnia or some other mystical realm. Meanwhile, I was supposed to be sipping coffee in Copenhagen on a Saturday morning, but noooo, life had other plans. I finally made it home on Monday evening, exhausted, cranky, and with no time to recover because work doesn’t care about my travel woes. And my luggage? Still MIA. 🙅‍♂️

So, there I was, innocently booking my flight with Emirates, thinking I’d be treated like royalty. After all, I paid extra for that fancy logo on the plane. But oh no, they had other plans for me—plans that involved more twists and turns than a telenovela.

Dear Austrian airline, here’s a suggestion: Maybe invest in some empathy, a few extra wheelchairs, and a heater or two. Because next time, I’m bringing my own thermal socks and a megaphone to shout my complaints. And if anyone asks, I’ll blame it all on you! 🙅‍♂️✈️

Emirates, consider this my official complaint: You owe me legroom, sanity, and a heartfelt apology. Next time, I’m flying with pigeons—they’ve got more leg space! 🕊️✈️
And both airlines consider this my official complaint: Your delays, reschedules, and lost luggage shenanigans have turned me into a rage-fueled traveler. Next time, I’m taking a teleporter. At least that way, I won’t have to deal with your nonsense! 😤✈️

P.S. My lost luggage is still out there, probably sipping champagne in first class. 🧳🥂",,,bad airline listen up because i ve got a bone to pick with the entire airline industry so there i was innocently booking my flight from tehran ika to dubai you d think it d be a straightforward journey right wrong the flight from tehran decided to play hide and seek with time delaying itself by a whopping to minutes and what s my reward for patiently waiting a measly hour and minutes for my stopover in dubai but oh no the drama doesn t end there was the flight canceled were we late who knows the airline in all its infinite wisdom decided to reschedule us for the next day yes you heard me right the next day so there i was stranded in dubai twiddling my thumbs waiting for the th of april like it was some grand event now brace yourselves for the pi ce de r sistance the flight from dubai to vienna and then from vienna to copenhagen another stopover this time a mere hour and minutes but guess what the first flight true to form decided to channel its inner sloth and delay itself by more precious minutes passport control oh don t even get me started i stood in that queue longer than it takes to binge watch an entire season of a netflix series and what do i get for my troubles a missed flight to copenhagen so what s a weary traveler to do spend the night in the airport with my friend s parents which they age years old of course because nothing says luxury vacation like a cold hard airport bench first they shuffled me off to austria like a deck of cards why who knows maybe they thought i needed a scenic detour through the alps but let me tell you my knees weren t thrilled about this unexpected european adventure the space between those chairs was tighter than a corset at a victorian ball and let s talk about the bad plans they swapped me onto i didn t sign up for this if i wanted a cramped seat i d have taken the bus but no i was promised luxury and all i got was a sore back and a grumpy attitude so there i was stranded in vienna airport overnight my pockets lighter and my patience thinner than a wafer why you ask because apparently the airline s idea of hospitality is pay up or freeze yep i had to dig into my own pocket to buy food and essentials no vouchers no warm blankets just a cold hard reality check that airlines don t care about our comfort but wait it gets worse remember my friend s elderly parents the ones who ve seen more winters than the airport s hvac system well they were in the same boat or should i say frosty airplane hangar eighty years old shivering and probably regretting their life choices just like the rest of us and let s talk about the wheelchair debacle we asked for help pleaded for assistance but the airport staff were as elusive as unicorns no wheelchairs magically appeared so my friend s parents had to navigate the airport like olympic sprinters off the plane into the passport control queue and then a mad dash to catch the next flight spoiler alert we missed it and let s not forget the pi ce de r sistance part deux my lost luggage yep my bags decided to take a detour to narnia or some other mystical realm meanwhile i was supposed to be sipping coffee in copenhagen on a saturday morning but noooo life had other plans i finally made it home on monday evening exhausted cranky and with no time to recover because work doesn t care about my travel woes and my luggage still mia so there i was innocently booking my flight with emirates thinking i d be treated like royalty after all i paid extra for that fancy logo on the plane but oh no they had other plans for me plans that involved more twists and turns than a telenovela dear austrian airline here s a suggestion maybe invest in some empathy a few extra wheelchairs and a heater or two because next time i m bringing my own thermal socks and a megaphone to shout my complaints and if anyone asks i ll blame it all on you emirates consider this my official complaint you owe me legroom sanity and a heartfelt apology next time i m flying with pigeons they ve got more leg space and both airlines consider this my official complaint your delays reschedules and lost luggage shenanigans have turned me into a rage fueled traveler next time i m taking a teleporter at least that way i won t have to deal with your nonsense p s my lost luggage is still out there probably sipping champagne in first class ,0.9737,Positive,Cabin Crew

I have more details that can help with its identification (as my husband supplied the lost luggage report after being without sleep for 48 hours while I searched for our connecting transfer outside the airport to make sure we didn't lose it).
One email from Emirates on a no-reply email address. They have ended the web chat before it started because they are so busy apparently. Currently on hold to the only phone number supplied (charged at £2.10 a minute by my provider EE) and getting angrier and angrier at the appalling lack of service.
How do I actually get to communicate the information that could help locate my baggage?!
These things happen but why not provide an email address so that I can communicate information that might help?
Utterly disgusted right now.

Jamie Meyer,Turkey,1,"Worlds worst Airline
An airline should ne rated on how they handle a crisis and not how they operate under usual operating conditions.

Sadely Emirate take first place in the worlds most disgusting airline awards.

The media release from Sir Tim Clark offering a faux apology is an embarrassment to their brand.
They abandoned thousands of people with no food, water or shelter whilst in transit then ultimately pushed us out of the terminal and locked it behind us.

Emirates treat their passengers as cargo and dont even acknowledge their appalling treatment. Starving their passengers and abandoning them mid journey is disgusting.

Imran,United Kingdom,3,"Emirates Airlines A Disastrous Journey and Lost Baggage
Today, on April 22, I haven't received any updates from the airport staff about the whereabouts of my bags. It's really frustrating not knowing what's happening.

My recent trip with Emirates Airlines was a total disaster. The flight from London to Sialkot on April 17, 2024, was a mess. We had to wait at the airport for 2 hours, then another 4 hours, and even longer before we could finally board the plane.

When we arrived in Dubai for our next flight, we were stuck on the plane for 7 hours before it took off. It was terrible, and nobody explained what was going on.

To make things worse, when I got to Sialkot, my two bags were missing. I told Emirates Airlines about it, but they haven't done anything to help.

Their customer service is really bad. I paid extra for business class, but it was still terrible. Even the seats on their fancy A380 plane weren't comfortable. When I asked the cabin crew about it, they said that one of the planes was an old model, which was really disappointing.

Emirates Airlines really disappointed me.

Marcel van Willigen,Poland,1,"Emirates Management failed everyone
Due to the rainfall in UAE, our flight on 18th April got delayed several times and then cancelled with no explanation or information.
Then the next TWO DAYS we had to spend in queues to get a flight rebooked, we spend 9 hours in a line without getting to the front. We left the queue after being told to go to a gate to catch a flight to our desitnation, 50+ people who hoped to get on were there. The flight was double booked already so not a single person was able to get on and were told just go back in line. We did manage to get a flight and they didn't put our luggage in that flight and its still pending to be found/shipped.

Parents with children and elderly were not taken care of. There was even a demented lady that lost her caregiver, passengers took care of her both the airline, Airport and police did nothing for hours! People fainted and again passengers helped no one working there until very late.

There was no food, water being supplied for hours, this was already on the 18th several days after the event how is it possible the airline and airport were not prepared for this at all...

Absolutely appalling Performance from Emirates, as well as the airport and especially their management. I can't fault the crew as much as they were overworked, tired and tried their best. Their management should really resign.

Kevin,United Kingdom,21,"Emirates Airlines abandoned us !!
Emirates - utter disgrace how we were treated !!!
This is a somewhat lengthy read but I ask you to read it as I am sure it is representative of many many other recent experiences with Emirates Airlines from the recent Dubai airport disruption.
We received email 17th April inviting us to check in on line for flights on 19th April EK657 Male to Dubai and EK9 Dubai to Gatwick.
We checked in on-line 17th April for both flights, seats had been previously purchased as pre-booked. Confirmation received from Emirates that on-line check-in successful.
Departed resort at 05.30am 19th April for 09.15 flight EK657 Male to Dubai.
At Emirates bag drop Male airport at about 07.00am the Emirates check-in clerk said that Emirates would only accept our bags for Dubai if we accepted that our flight ended in Dubai and that Emirates had no further travel responsibility for us.
We said to Emirates we had flight EK9 booked and confirmed for the same day of 19th April. Emirates clerk said that there were NO FLIGHTS leaving Dubai on 19th April.
We said what are we supposed to do in Dubai, and Emirates clerk said it would be down to us to find a flight with whoever we wanted and it would be down to us to find accommodation and get food etc…
We said to the Emirates clerk that it was down to them to get us to our final destination. The Emirates clerk disagreed and kept repeating that Emirates would only fly us to Dubai and then in effect abandon us.
With this we kept repeating that Emirates had to get us to our final destination and in the end the Emirates check-in clerk took us to the Emirates reservation desk at Male airport. That clerk spent a long time on his phone and looking at his computer. He said there were no flights out of Dubai.
We pressed him that Emirates had an obligation to get us to our final destination of London Gatwick. Eventually he suggested a flight on 27th April - he did not say what time, what flight number or even where the flight was going. That was 8 days away and we said what about accommodation and food. The Emirates clerk said it was not Emirates problem and we would have to arrange all accommodation and food ourselves.
Meanwhile and whilst these conversations were taking place and at least half a dozen power cuts at Male airport it was announced over the airport public address system that there would be no check-in of any travellers to Dubai who had onward flights from Dubai. The announcement also said that anyone flying to Dubai was required to leave the airport building due to overcrowding. So if you had no onward flight (which nobody had) you would be ejected from Dubai airport with nowhere to go and no way of knowing how or when you could fly out.
We asked Emirates about arrangements with other airlines (British Airways, Etihad, Qatar, Singapore Airlines) and the Emirates clerk stated they had no arrangement with these airlines. It starts to become increasingly apparent that Emirates has no contingency planning or disaster planning in place.
At this point we were now stranded at Male airport with Emirates Airline effectively washing their hands of any travellers going to Dubai who had onward flights.
At this point also Male airport had rapidly filled with travellers not being able to start their journeys. When we had arrived at about 06.30 it was reasonably quiet - by 10.30 there were people everywhere and a lot getting impatient and upset, many with families. It was clearly very distressing for some.
We therefore had no choice but to look at other airlines and managed to book with British Airways for 21st April at a cost of $2,700 for 2 economy tickets. This flight is to T5 Heathrow whereas our car is parked at Gatwick North, so our inconvenience will not end when we get to London.
For accommodation we made contact with the resort we had been staying at (Eriyadu) and they very professionally arranged to get us back from the airport and has provided accommodation for 2 nights - all at an additional cost to us of $860.
Emirates Airlines has to be named and shamed for an utterly contemptible and disgraceful service. They have made a small fortune in the airline business and have failed miserably when so many of their customers needed them to perform. There should be wholesale dismissals within Emirates for complete and utter incompetence, along with the highest possible corporate fines for gross negligence.

Madde,Sweden,3,"If I could give it -5 stars I would
If I could give it -5 stars I would. This airline does not know how to handle an emergency crisis, it is crucial for companies like them to prepare in case of emergencies. The flooding may not be “their” fault, but not knowing how to manage it is totally their fault. A company like Emirates should ALWAYS be prepared and have a plan for everything that COULD happen in the future. This disaster just proves how unsafe your passengers are under your hands.

I will forever be traumatized by this experience at your main airport Dubai International Airport.

Furthermore, I will write a short conclusion of what I’ve endured being locked in your airport.

An expensive airline, in this case Emirates, should not cheap out on their costumers. This airline made PROFIT out of this crisis. Stranded passengers had to pay for their OWN FOOD. You are considered “lucky” if your one voucher works. During our two days stay in your airport we only got one (1!) voucher that could ONLY cover for the cheapest meal in McDonalds. Imagine being someone traveling on a budget, or someone that can’t go queue to different restaurants because of their disabilities. I’ve talked to many young and tired travelers - they all haven’t eaten for days because Dubai International Airport won't resolve the issue.

The biggest issue in my opinion is Emirates and their airport-hub’s lack of communication and structure. We wanted answers and updates on what’s going on. No agent came to our gate at all!

Dubai International Airport together with Emirates NEEDS to work on their structure and organization. The queue line to the Connection Desk (there were only four working ones in the whole entire airport during my experience) was awfully long. It could take the whole day just to get in touch with someone. I am wondering how the management thought that it still was a good idea after hearing complaints from many in the queue.

The worst part was seeing people breaking down crying because of the awful management of Dubai International Airport and Emirates. Single travelers losing hope and feeling fatigued and hungry. Families with small children not knowing how to make it comfortable for their children because Emirates would not issue hotel rooms to us. In fact, Emirates tried their best to avoid paying for our accommodations. We know why you delayed our boarding every hour, so your company would not legally have to give us hotel rooms. That inhumane method limited costumers tremendously! People were afraid to leave their gates because of the fear of missing the “boarding”.

My entire body aches from that disaster of an airport. I know that I am not the only one feeling that way. Emirates SHOULD reimburse everything we have spent in that airport - mobile data, food, extra underwear and clothes and food. The airport food was too overpriced for a normal traveler, especially someone stranded there for days.

I would like to give appreciation to the flight crew and the airport personnel who actively worked in the airport. The HIGHER UPS caused this disaster. STOP having meetings about what future meetings should be about. MAKE a decision as soon as possible. COMMUNICATE with the people working tirelessly in the airport. PAY your paying costumers back Emirates.",1,,if i could give it stars i would if i could give it stars i would this airline does not know how to handle an emergency crisis it is crucial for companies like them to prepare in case of emergencies the flooding may not be their fault but not knowing how to manage it is totally their fault a company like emirates should always be prepared and have a plan for everything that could happen in the future this disaster just proves how unsafe your passengers are under your hands i will forever be traumatized by this experience at your main airport dubai international airport furthermore i will write a short conclusion of what i ve endured being locked in your airport an expensive airline in this case emirates should not cheap out on their costumers this airline made profit out of this crisis stranded passengers had to pay for their own food you are considered lucky if your one voucher works during our two days stay in your airport we only got one voucher that could only cover for the cheapest meal in mcdonalds imagine being someone traveling on a budget or someone that can t go queue to different restaurants because of their disabilities i ve talked to many young and tired travelers they all haven t eaten for days because dubai international airport won t resolve the issue the biggest issue in my opinion is emirates and their airport hub s lack of communication and structure we wanted answers and updates on what s going on no agent came to our gate at all dubai international airport together with emirates needs to work on their structure and organization the queue line to the connection desk there were only four working ones in the whole entire airport during my experience was awfully long it could take the whole day just to get in touch with someone i am wondering how the management thought that it still was a good idea after hearing complaints from many in the queue the worst part was seeing people breaking down crying because of the awful management of dubai international airport and emirates single travelers losing hope and feeling fatigued and hungry families with small children not knowing how to make it comfortable for their children because emirates would not issue hotel rooms to us in fact emirates tried their best to avoid paying for our accommodations we know why you delayed our boarding every hour so your company would not legally have to give us hotel rooms that inhumane method limited costumers tremendously people were afraid to leave their gates because of the fear of missing the boarding my entire body aches from that disaster of an airport i know that i am not the only one feeling that way emirates should reimburse everything we have spent in that airport mobile data food extra underwear and clothes and food the airport food was too overpriced for a normal traveler especially someone stranded there for days i would like to give appreciation to the flight crew and the airport personnel who actively worked in the airport the higher ups caused this disaster stop having meetings about what future meetings should be about make a decision as soon as possible communicate with the people working tirelessly in the airport pay your paying costumers back emirates ,-0.9913,Negative,Cabin Crew

Deserves 0 stars. Absolutely disgusting from emirates at Dubai Airport. Arrived 16th April after a 11.5 hour taxi ride. No message before we left to advise against travelling to the airport. No staff at departures to help or advise. Waited 2 hours at the ticket desk to be told no available seats until 24th April. Went to the check in desks to get on a waiting list. Placed on standby list, then given seats on the 02:45 Gatwick plane. No assistance for our disabled friend and 45 minutes to get through security. Finally checked in, kept being delayed every 30 minutes for 8 hours then finally cancelled. Staff kept changing their stories to why it was being delayed. Only found out it was cancelled from a first class customer on the phone to emirates, even then the manager at the check in desk refused to say it was cancelled. Had to go to the connections desk, it was chaos. 3 hour wait with hardly any DBX staff facilitating the queue. One of our party is disabled so managed to speak to a manager, booked onto the Birmingham flight 14:55, 11 hour delay and finally left. No emirates staff to help or provide re assurance. Pregnant women on the floor, babies crying, elderly stuck in wheelchairs. No food vouchers even after 24 hours in the airport.
I asked about my luggage when changing to the Birmingham flight and was told it was taken care off and definitely would be onboard. Unbelievably the flight was half empty, except in business which was full. I was told that business seats were the only ones available online at inflated prices.

I understand the difficulties disruption from the man made rain that’s been caused but still expect more professional service. Hardly any sleep as we had to sleep on the corridor floors. We are one of many. Disappointed to say the least.
Edited - finally got a flight to Brisbane the next day and no luggage - 4 days in and still no sign of our luggage.

Amy Duncan,United Kingdom,2,"This was the WORST most INHUMANE…
This was the WORST most INHUMANE experience we've ever had to date, with any airline. no support or guidance from the Emirates team - in fact they shouted and laughed at us

Flights were cancelled the Tuesday before we were due to fly because of extreme weather, which is understandable, BUT the Wednesday after we were still told to come to the airport, even though no Tuesday passengers had flown. Our flight was rescheduled 6 times, and then eventually cancelled just after midnight.

We were told to stay at the airport until 9am the following day to maybe get a flight

NO FOOD, WATER OR ACCOMODEATION was provided at all, and when I asked for a blanket to sleep on the floor I was laughed at. My reason for asking was I have very severe arthritis and my hips are fusing together so sleeping on a marble floor was very painful - this was not respected or taken seriously at all. There was another passenger with Type one Diabetes who was also accused of making diabetes up as the staff did not know what it was

There has been no information or system in rebooking flights, Customers form Thursday onwards have been checked in, but all of the Tuesday and Wednesday passengers have been TOTALLY ignored and bullied into buying incredibly inflated new tickets

The airport itself is chaos and a huge health and safety violation. Yesterday there were 35,000 passengers in the airport and only 2 members of staff on the help desk. Everyone received the same information which was totally useless and just sent everyone around in circles. the web chat kicked people out immediately and the phone lines were impossible to access, the ONLY people that managed to get through were those who requested that relatives they have in INDIA call to reshedule their flight

So far we have had to spend 48 hours on the airport floor with no support, rude mocking staff and have had to fork out more money finding a hotel locally which emirates have expressed no intention to help with at all

This is the WORST experience I have ever had with any airline, Ryan air was more comfortable and had much kinder and respectful staff

We still have no idea at all about when our flight will be, according to Emirates they cant do anything because on their system we have already flown, which is absurd

I understand that the rain was out of their control, but its been over 72 hours since the rain and their organisation and procedure to help guide us through it has been totally appalling

I would avoid this airline at all costs, all they care about is money

we cant even register a complaint or apply for a refund because our flight still hasn't happened so they wont let us register a complaint",,,this was the worst most inhumane this was the worst most inhumane experience we ve ever had to date with any airline no support or guidance from the emirates team in fact they shouted and laughed at us flights were cancelled the tuesday before we were due to fly because of extreme weather which is understandable but the wednesday after we were still told to come to the airport even though no tuesday passengers had flown our flight was rescheduled times and then eventually cancelled just after midnight we were told to stay at the airport until am the following day to maybe get a flight no food water or accomodeation was provided at all and when i asked for a blanket to sleep on the floor i was laughed at my reason for asking was i have very severe arthritis and my hips are fusing together so sleeping on a marble floor was very painful this was not respected or taken seriously at all there was another passenger with type one diabetes who was also accused of making diabetes up as the staff did not know what it was there has been no information or system in rebooking flights customers form thursday onwards have been checked in but all of the tuesday and wednesday passengers have been totally ignored and bullied into buying incredibly inflated new tickets the airport itself is chaos and a huge health and safety violation yesterday there were passengers in the airport and only members of staff on the help desk everyone received the same information which was totally useless and just sent everyone around in circles the web chat kicked people out immediately and the phone lines were impossible to access the only people that managed to get through were those who requested that relatives they have in india call to reshedule their flight so far we have had to spend hours on the airport floor with no support rude mocking staff and have had to fork out more money finding a hotel locally which emirates have expressed no intention to help with at all this is the worst experience i have ever had with any airline ryan air was more comfortable and had much kinder and respectful staff we still have no idea at all about when our flight will be according to emirates they cant do anything because on their system we have already flown which is absurd i understand that the rain was out of their control but its been over hours since the rain and their organisation and procedure to help guide us through it has been totally appalling i would avoid this airline at all costs all they care about is money we cant even register a complaint or apply for a refund because our flight still hasn t happened so they wont let us register a complaint,-0.9913,Negative,Cabin Crew

Abysmal customer service from the moment we got on the flight at Manchester airport. Staff not interested in their passengers, ignoring passengers request for assistance and more or less calling one lady a liar when she reported an issue with a faulty seat. This was just the start!!!!

We received an email this morning cancelling our flight back home through dubai this evening (21:00 Aus time) which we understood given current issues in Dubai. However #Emirates get worse from their. Their customer service is non existent, they referred us to our travel agents and washed their hands with us. When we contacted #Trailfinders they contacted #Emirates who said they had it in hand and we should go to the airport.

On arrival at Brisbane airport we were then told by the #Emirates customer services reps that they had no liability for getting us home, when asked about accommodation the #Emirates reps told us to ""borrow and contact our family for support as it is nothing to do with us"". I asked him if he expected us to beg and borrow from family and his response was simply ""yes, we #Emirates have no liability or recourse for your situation.

Nick Johns,United Kingdom,34,"Dreadful customer service and apathy…
After spending nearly £4K with PH Travel / Emirates on a holiday to Thailand, you would have thought our flights would have a little class, a little upgrade on EasyJet and Ryanair.

You got to be joking, I will never ever fly with Emirates or use PH Travel again as between the pair of them, they caused our family significant inconvenience, our flight expectations were completely mismanaged and we are left feeling very dissatisfied.

First, we had the inconvenience of our return home flights changing which resulted in us hanging around Dubai Airport for an additional 10 hours, losing half a day of our holiday with no compensation offered for sustenance.

With a beer at £13.00 a pint, a black coffee at £5.00, a coke at £6.00 and a burger at £12.00 at the Airport then we are significantly out of pocket.

On the flight from Heathrow to Dubai, we flew with Emirates and their on-flight Entertainment was free.

On the flight from Dubai to Krabi, not only did not we fly with Emirates which we were completely unaware of, we flew with Fly Dubai who apparently is one of Emirates partners, did PH Travel or Emirates make us aware of this in advance? No, course they never.

Why was this a problem?

Well, there was a charge to use the on-flight Entertainment and for on board drinks which we never had on Emirates and where we were not told in advance.

My fold out table was broken so I had to eat my meal on my lap (see photos) and apparently, mine was the 3rd different complaint of a broken table.

Fly Dubai was such a small plane, on the return flight, trying to get access to the only two toilets on the plane was so difficult that people were queuing in the aisles and at the back where the food comes from, it was utter chaos, what a way to be treated by this airline.

I have just reviewed my paperwork and it makes no mention that we would be flying with Fly Dubai so I feel that we as customers have had our expectations completely mis-managed and basically, we have been misinformed.

The connecting Emirates flight back to the U.K. was just as bad as I sat in my seat only for the TV not to be working. I was moved to another seat and that TV did not work either.

A TV is not everything, it is helpful when your flight has been pushed back to nearly 3AM and you struggle to sleep on a plane.

You could not make it up, bear in mind, we paid £4K for this, Emirates should be a high quality airline, how wrong we were?

The lack of care, consideration and customer service from Emirates has been appalling and I will ensure that my family will never fly with them again.

We will also inform everyone we can, never to fly with them.

Between PH Travel Ltd and Emirates, we have been passed from pillar to post over the last few months trying to get satisfaction for complaints each one has said it’s the other’s responsibility, the Civil Aviation Authority are also not interested in hearing about our complaints, (They are a joke) all of them are shambolic and for the money we paid and the time this has cost us then this is totally unacceptable, rubbish value for money and I feel ripped off.

What are they going to do about this?

That’s right….Nothing!

I will warn you all out there, never fly with Emirates, the value for money is appalling and quite frankly they don’t care about you as customers and there are much better airlines to fly to South East Asia with.

REPEAT - Choose any other airline but Emirates - Absolutely appalling!

Finally, as for PH Travel Ltd? What support and customer care did they provide???

Nothing!!

As for those incompetents at the CAA who are not interested in customer complaints.. well…

My next steps will be to contact Trading Standards and the Consumer Watchdog.

However- I will say that the Emirates Flight Attendants/ Stewardess and people on the ground at all Airports were superb, very efficient, friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them.",1,,dreadful customer service and apathy after spending nearly k with ph travel emirates on a holiday to thailand you would have thought our flights would have a little class a little upgrade on easyjet and ryanair you got to be joking i will never ever fly with emirates or use ph travel again as between the pair of them they caused our family significant inconvenience our flight expectations were completely mismanaged and we are left feeling very dissatisfied first we had the inconvenience of our return home flights changing which resulted in us hanging around dubai airport for an additional hours losing half a day of our holiday with no compensation offered for sustenance with a beer at a pint a black coffee at a coke at and a burger at at the airport then we are significantly out of pocket on the flight from heathrow to dubai we flew with emirates and their on flight entertainment was free on the flight from dubai to krabi not only did not we fly with emirates which we were completely unaware of we flew with fly dubai who apparently is one of emirates partners did ph travel or emirates make us aware of this in advance no course they never why was this a problem well there was a charge to use the on flight entertainment and for on board drinks which we never had on emirates and where we were not told in advance my fold out table was broken so i had to eat my meal on my lap see photos and apparently mine was the rd different complaint of a broken table fly dubai was such a small plane on the return flight trying to get access to the only two toilets on the plane was so difficult that people were queuing in the aisles and at the back where the food comes from it was utter chaos what a way to be treated by this airline i have just reviewed my paperwork and it makes no mention that we would be flying with fly dubai so i feel that we as customers have had our expectations completely mis managed and basically we have been misinformed the connecting emirates flight back to the u k was just as bad as i sat in my seat only for the tv not to be working i was moved to another seat and that tv did not work either a tv is not everything it is helpful when your flight has been pushed back to nearly am and you struggle to sleep on a plane you could not make it up bear in mind we paid k for this emirates should be a high quality airline how wrong we were the lack of care consideration and customer service from emirates has been appalling and i will ensure that my family will never fly with them again we will also inform everyone we can never to fly with them between ph travel ltd and emirates we have been passed from pillar to post over the last few months trying to get satisfaction for complaints each one has said it s the other s responsibility the civil aviation authority are also not interested in hearing about our complaints they are a joke all of them are shambolic and for the money we paid and the time this has cost us then this is totally unacceptable rubbish value for money and i feel ripped off what are they going to do about this that s right nothing i will warn you all out there never fly with emirates the value for money is appalling and quite frankly they don t care about you as customers and there are much better airlines to fly to south east asia with repeat choose any other airline but emirates absolutely appalling finally as for ph travel ltd what support and customer care did they provide nothing as for those incompetents at the caa who are not interested in customer complaints well my next steps will be to contact trading standards and the consumer watchdog however i will say that the emirates flight attendants stewardess and people on the ground at all airports were superb very efficient friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them ,0.0193,Neutral,Cabin Crew
Jellyfish,United Kingdom,5,"The worst airline ever
An absolutely diabolical lack of any information or support offered to passengers stranded in Dubai since Tuesday. Emirates staff is nowhere to be seen and when you do miraculously get to speak to anyone they can’t give you any answers. You can’t rebook your cancelled flight online, you need to queue for hours at Connections desk where sparse numbers of staff take about 40 minutes to deal with a single customer as they need to ring through to their call centre. Hundreds of flights got delayed and thousands of people spent two nights on the floor and being offered no assistance whatsoever apart from occasional meal voucher that gets you a bottle of water and a packet of crisps if you’re lucky. My original flight to Manchester on Tuesday night kept getting pushed back until finally got cancelled 13 hours later and all delays were only communicated via a screen at the departure gate. Then was told to queue for hours to get booked onto another flight. No available flights to Manchester for a week apparently so got booked to go to Stansted. Unfortunately the same thing happened. The departure time kept getting changed as well as the departure gate. Did over 15k steps walking between three different terminals for the flight to be finally cancelled at midnight. Again no assistance offered, had to queue for 7 hours to be booked onto Heathrow flight which is now again being repeatedly delayed so most likely will get cancelled again. Still no communication from the airline, no staff at the gate and the changes only get communicated via the gate screen. Absolutely diabolical that you can treat your customers like this.

Debora Paiva,Australia,1,"Terrible assistance

I never thought I would ever complaint about Emirates, every time I travel Brazil-Australia through Emirates I had an amazing service on board and the plane is very comfortable.
Till today, 17/04/2024 I had nothing to complain. But after the big storm in Dubai, my mother stayed locked in the airplane after landed for 8 hours, no food, no assistance, no information!!!! She is 64 years old, she has problem to walk, I even requested the wheel chair and transfer assistance to take her from one gate to the other. After 8 hours, when they let the passengers out of the plane, she didn’t get any assistance and had to walk a lot, as we know Dubai airport is huge!!! She lined up for 3 hours to get a new board pass, they gave her a boarding pass for 08:20am on 17/04/24, but it was already 22:10 17/04/24 when they give it to her.
She didn’t eat for this whole time, she started throwing up because of her anxiety, no one to give any information. Now they booked her in for on flight at 09:05 on 18/04/24, let’s see if it gonna happen.

The problem is not rescheduled the flight due the bad weather, the problem was the emirates didn’t give any assistance to the passengers, including my mum who is aged person and has disability.

Allan Marsh,United Kingdom,11,"Emirates Customer (Dis)Service
Horrific experience. Flight from Manchester was delayed by the rainstorm in Dubai (EK22 16 April). Arrived Dubai an hour late which isn’t too bad, but then we had a 2.5 hour wait for our luggage to appear. Once it did appear, there was no way to leave the arrivals hall. Doors leading outside were blocked off, no taxis, the queue for taxis was around half a mile long and growing by the minute, Metro was out of service… so we arrived at around 9.30pm, had to sleep on the floor of the arrivals hall, eventually managed to get on the Metro at just after 7am, then had to wait 2 hours for an Uber to get to our hotel

Almost none of this was the fault of Emirates, but what WAS the fault of Emirates was that we literally didn’t see a single Emirates employee during the whole ordeal. There’s no Emirates baggage desk in the baggage hall, no Emirates customer service desk in the arrivals hall, they don’t answer the phone or respond to social media requests… they provided ZERO service and hundreds and hundreds of people were left to fend for themselves. They didn’t give any advice, travel updates, suggestions… nothing.

I certainly won’t be in a rush to book with Emirates again. Their service has been going down the toilet for years, but they’ve reached an all time low.

April,United Kingdom,5,"Staff charged me extra for a 900 grams excess baggage!
I chose to fly with Emirates although I'm aware that there are cheaper options out there, as I've had really good experience with Emirates previously. On board Manila-Dubai-London flight, we had a ridiculously waiting time of at least one hour upon arrival in the airport to the baggage counter. To make it worse, I only had 900grams excess baggage, yet the staff handling the baggages forced me to pay for an extra 1kg (which equates to roughly £25)!!!! This is the first time Emirates charged me for an excess baggage. Other airlines that I took before (i.e. Singapore Airlines, Etihad, Qatar, etc.) were generous when it comes to excess baggage, even though it was a full flight! I flew with Emirates before and they were generous on excess baggage so this came as a surprise to me that I was forced to pay for a 900 gram excess! Although I want to re-open my suitcase and remove the extra 900g so I don't have to pay a VERY EXPENSIVE FLIGHT by the way, I didn't do it because we've waited long enough and I don't want to delay those people waiting behind me even further!
The seats weren't comfortable as well, not as spacious as your other airline! It's so infuriating to pay excess baggage for a 900 grams extra, with seats so small, delayed departure, very long waiting time at the baggage counter, broken printer as our boarding pass wouldn't print, and unresponsive POS terminal when I paid for the excess baggage! I've allotted 4hrs for my flight, yet I got too stressed for all the factors I've mentioned above, worried sick if I'd be able to make it in time on my flight!

Seb,United Kingdom,31,"No customer service, no compensation for delayed baggage
Horrible experience, the flight was mainly ok, but my luggage was delayed by more than 24h.
I was promised a compensation of £50 that I never got.
Chased via chat (they have been useless) over the phone (again useless) , they say the only way is via email.
I raised complaint waited 30 working days, nothing, chased again, still nothing, appalling service will never use them again.

keith tatters,United Kingdom,6,"Oh how the mighty have fallen
Oh how the mighty have fallen, this airline company has fallen to a new low. Flew to Dubai from Newcastle in march and have to say how very poor the cabin crew were, rude and forgetful it was so shambolic. Gone are the days when they would come round offering people a drink, now you have to press a button above your head to ask for a drink, they must be saving a fortune. When it came to the meal service it ended up a farce with cabin crew forgetting to give out various peoples meals and not offering a drink with your meal, you had to ask for a drink and if they did not have a certain drink they said they would go to back of plane and return, which they never did. It was a lottery if you got a drink or not and one crew member was very rude to some people in front of me saying they were drinking to much and should be hydrating and not dehydrating ( chance would be a fine thing). If you were lucky enough for a crew member to answer your call ( I was not) they would go get your order but then forget who had ordered it so just went up and down the aisle shouting ""Who ordered the Tiger beer"", it was just farcical. A little tub of ice cream or a small packet of popcorn was your last offering before arriving in Dubai. It's no exaggeration to say like other people have said on here that Jet 2 and easyjet couldn't do any worse than these clowns.
On the return flight the crew were better but my seat was so uncomfortable, hardly any padding in the seat all. The triple 7 planes have without doubt have seen better days and need refurbished.
I had already booked another holiday to Mauritius in June last August before booking my recent experience and If I knew Emirates had turned this bad I would of booked BA via Heathrow instead.
Just to rub salt into the wounds I have just been informed by the travel agent I booked with (Destination 2) that Emirates want another £49 from me as a late surcharge even though I paid my balance 10 days a go. Absolutely disgraceful!!!!!!!!

Ambreen,United Arab Emirates,1,"Harassed by EK check in staff from check-in to the boarding gates
I travelled from Birmingham to Dubai with Emirates. I always loved EMIRATES AIRLINE which means for me travelling means, ONLY AND ONLY EMIRATES. However my experience with Birmingham check in staff, and the duty manager has forced me to say, that was my last ever trip with Emirates. The check in staff and line manger has exhibited an adverse behaviour and harassed me until I have boarded myself in the flight. From check in area where my hand luggaged was fussed, I fixed it, then my hand bag was weighed too, to include it in my hand luggage allowances. All my life travelling with Emirates, my hand bag was never weighed however when the staff who lack training in diversity and respecting passengers, such rules could be rolled out on the spot, I learnt from Emirates check in staff on 13th April 2024. I was threatened to be off loaded from the flight too. PROPER EXHIBITION OF POWER when given to less able personnel.
The line manager involved another staff member to take my ID at gates by lying that my baggage tag has got ripped, NOTHING OF SUCH information may come to the staff who are serving gates and check-in, in the history of aviation. The real truth was, the staff held my passport in his hand and actually questioned me if I have taken staff's pictures. I had taken the picture of the gate, to remember for writing my complain. My passport was handed in only when I said what was the true fact. I mean when will such staff ever receive the training to serve the passengers equally, I wonder? ONLY AND ONLY my hand luggage was weighed at the gate that night, the rest of the passengers were just allowed to enter the gate. I was thinking such a good airline once, has polluted the image of this great airline so much which may only be sanitised when these staff will receive continuous training on customer services and diversity and respect.

Let's first say I was very excited about flying with Emirates. This would be both me and my first time. We are traveling to Dubai for the first time on our 11th anniversary. I called customer service six times before I booked and looked through the website multiple times before I booked our flight. Through the conversations with the reps and reading through the website, I was told I could use miles to upgrade my seats. I was also told how many points I needed to upgrade my seats. So I opened the Emirates card to get 60k miles, joined the Skyward program to get 10k miles and other benefits, transferred miles from other points programs, and purchased additional miles from Skyward. I bought the ticket in March, and now I am being told (April) that ""the upgrade with miles is never guaranteed. It completely depends on the flight statistics."" None of the previous reps mentioned this, nor is it visible on the website. Had I been told this, I would have never purchased all this and taken those steps to get miles. I was scammed. All I want is to use my miles as I was told I would be able to. I have never had a miles program that does not allow you to use the points right away. I have had Jetblue for years and never had an issue using points. I thought this airline was supposed to be upscale, so I didn't expect it to be a scam. So disappointed. So the last rep I spoke to basically told me that there is nothing anyone can do, and all I can do is submit a complaint. That is sad. HOPEFULLY THIS HELPS OTHER NOT GET SCAMMED LIKE ME.

I did not really understand her irritation, too big deal for her to deal with, then her failure not finding a space for my bag made a big blow of embarrassment on her. Now the passengers eyes were now focused on her. She complains but have no solution. She did not understand the reason why I put the bag under the seat in front of me, eventhough it was the only way/solution.

Colin Lawrence,United Kingdom,70,"Gone Down Hill from a excellent company to the Worst
How can a company go from being so good to now being very very poor. We have had several flights on Emirates to Dubai and once to Australia and then found the service and flights excellent but recently we went from Stansted to Phuket and return . The first leg of the flight from Stansted to Dubai sitting in narrow seats row 40 apart from 2 terrible meals we were only offered 2 drinks (orange,Apple or water ) and apart from these occasions we never see a on board Steward at all . On the second leg Dubai to Phuket 7 hours we experienced the same service absolutely terrible 😞.
Just before our return flight I received a email from emirates it’s time to check in and the good news you CAN UPGRADE YOUR RETURN FLIGHT TO BUSINESS CLASS FOR BOTH PASSENGERS FOR £1172 THE WIFE AND I READ THE EMAIL SEVERAL TIMES TO MAKE SURE WE ARE GOING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. WE THEN DECIDED BECAUSE OF THE TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE ON OUR FLIGHTS FROM STANSTED TO PHUKET WE COULD NOT AFFORD TOO BUT DECIDED TO TAKE UP THE OFFER.
WHEN WE CHECKED IN IT WOULD ONLY LET US BOOK THE FLIGHT FROM PHUKET TO DUBAI NOT THE NEXT PART DUBAI TO STANSTED. WE WENT BACK TO LOOK AT THE EMAIL AGAIN BUT THE PART STATING THE OFFER HAD BEEN DELETED BECAUSE WE HAD TAKEN UP THE OFFER.
WE IMMEDIATELY WENT ON ONLINE CHAT WHICH NEVER OFFERED ANY HELP ASKED FOR A PHOTO SHOT OF THE OFFER WHICH WE COULD NOT PROVIDE HAS IT HAD NOW GONE . I ASKED FOR A REFUND AND WAS TOLD IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE HAD ENTERED A CONTRACT AND SENT US A LINK TO EMIRATES COMPLAINTS AND THEY WOULD COME BACK TO US BEFORE THE DAY IS OUT OR THE LATEST WITHIN 24 HOURS ! WELL ITS NOW OVER 7 DAYS WITHOUT REPONCE .
SO OUR NEXT EXPERIENCE AT PHUKET AIRPORT HAVE PAID THIS EXTRA TO GO BUSINESS CLASS WE HAD TO JOIN A LARGE QUEUE IN EMIGRATION WHICH NOT BEING A SNOB BUT THOUGHT THIS WAS PART OF BEING A BUSINESS CLASS PASSENGER THEN TO BOARD THE PLAN WE AGAIN HAD TO QUEUE TO CATCH A BUS THEN QUEUE TO CLIMB SOME STEPS WITH OUR HAND LUGGAGE.
AGAIN BECAUSE WE HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN THE UPGRADE WE WERE PROMISED ON THE COMPLETE JURNEY AND BEING COMPLETELY SQUISHED ON THE 2 OUTWARD FLIGHTS WE THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO PURCHASE 2 SEATS WITH EXTRA LEG ROOM £158 FOR 2 AILSE SEAT AND MIDDLE WHICH WAS OKAY BUT LUCKILY THE 3rd SEAT WAS NOT TAKEN BECAUSE WE WOULD HAD BEEN SQUISHED AGAIN AND BELIEVE ME THAT SEAT WAS SO NARROW I DO NOT THINK A ADULT COULD HAVE GOT THIER BUM INTO IT .
AND FINALLY BECAUSE OF ILLNESS AND COVID WE COULD NOT GO ON HOLIDAY OR FLY WE HAD OVER 25000 MILES EACH BUT THEY CANCELED ALL THE AIR MILES ON 31/12/23 EVEN THOUGH WE HAD PAID FOR OUR SEATS FOR THIS MARCH 2024 10 MONTHS EARLIER. BUT THER REPONCE WAS TUFF YOU HAD TIME TO USE THEM BUT YOU HAVE NOT .
AFTER THIS EXPERIENCE AND STIILL FIND IT HARD THAT A AIRLINE CAN GO FROM BEING ONE OF THE BEST TO NOW ONE OF THE WORST .

I was led to believe that this was a premium airline. How wrong I was!
Firstly, the plane was delayed due to ""rain"" so it was held in Dubai.
Now I accept that the rain was heavy but rain is expected in the Emirates in March and it often heavy and so it can hardly be ""unexpected"" as it happens every year. They gave us a food voucher for the legal minimum that wasn't enough to buy food anyway and then when we boarded we were stuck on the plane for well over an hour due to a ""technical fault"" which meant we had to return to the stand.

No drinks were offered during this time. We didn't get a drink for over two hours into the flight and people were getting very ansgty.

My ""pudding"" was two tiny boxes of children's fun size raisins that toddlers eat. The main menu was sticky toffee pudding. It was actually insane that they thought this was an acceptable alternative. I'm 51 for goodness sake.

My snack was a chickpea curry pastie at 4am which we were woken up for and it really wasn't worth it.

NSE,Netherlands,4,"Review Title: A Nightmare Experience with Emirates Airline
Ref: DXB/X/RJ/131023/7948153
I'm utterly disappointed and utterly disillusioned by the abysmal customer service provided by Emirates Airline. My ordeal began in October when I purchased a full first-class ticket worth $6,000, expecting nothing short of excellence from a reputed airline like Emirates. However, what followed was a cascade of incompetence, negligence, and utter disregard for customer satisfaction.

To start with, upon arrival, I discovered that my Rimowa luggage had been damaged during transit. I reached out to Emirates immediately, hoping for prompt resolution. Little did I know that this would mark the beginning of a six-month-long saga of frustration and disappointment.

Despite countless emails, phone calls, and promises of follow-ups, Emirates has consistently failed to provide any satisfactory response. It's baffling how a company of their stature can be so indifferent to customer concerns. Each time I've reached out, I've been met with empty promises and a complete lack of accountability.

What's even more infuriating is their blatant disregard for their commitments. After numerous assurances, I was promised a refund form via email, yet it never materialized. It's as if they have no intention of addressing their mistakes or making amends for the inconvenience caused.

As a paying customer who trusted Emirates with my hard-earned money, I feel utterly duped and betrayed. It's appalling that they can take advantage of their customers in such a manner without any repercussions. This experience has not only tarnished my perception of Emirates but also left me questioning the integrity of their entire operation.

I urge anyone considering Emirates Airline for their travel needs to think twice. Their dismal customer service and lack of accountability make them unworthy of any trust or patronage.

Laura Griffith,Australia,1,"No assistance for hearing impaired
I called the Emirates customer line today as I’m looking to book tickets for my parents who are disabled (hearing impaired, as in profoundly deaf and can only communicate in sign language, and don’t speak English) to come visit from Europe to Australia.
Upon enquiring about the assistance options to help navigate through the airports I’ve been told that unless they have a mobility issue they don’t provide assistance for people with hearing impairment. It is absolutely outrageous and discriminating, and it blows my mind how such a big company doesn’t provide assistance for people with certain disabilities, considering the tickets are priced at $3000 AUD/person.
They have flown twice before in Europe, short flights with low cost airlines which have been amazing at providing assistance from all the way from the check in desk, through security check and all the way to the gate. Very very disappointing
Update: I've submitted a Feedback/Complaint form explaining the conversation I had over the phone with the customer service employee and also left a comment on the Emirates Facebook.
So far 2 people have told me that they don't provide assistance for hearing impaired, and 3 people told me that they actually do.

Dominic C,United Kingdom,61,"EK031 Flight DXB to LHR - Rain delayed on 9th March 2024
I have just got off a rain-delayed flight from Dubai that was probably my worst in 25 years of living, working and flying in the Middle East. When it rains it pours, floods and despite warnings days in advance the 12.10pm flight was delayed an hour initially. Earlier flights only 30 minutes it seemed and the later flight took off around the time this flight did, delayed over 2 hours on the ground. As a consequence of the delay i missed my coach home and then was not able to get on a later full coach. I then had to pay again for a single ticket that cost more than the initial return! So not very impressed. Often flights leave late but time is made up. As the delay was under 3 hours and will be blamed on rain I can claim for nothing I am sure. The crew took ages to offer water having missed the slot and a further 40 minute wait announced. When we finally landed over 2 hours late the pilot failed to apologise to the passengers, many of whom may have missed connections. So it seems one of the largest global airlines cannot handle rain at its own hub? Not impressed. I hope Emirates respond as a longtime Skywards member along with my family.

I have subsequently been in touch with AIG regards travel insurance included (that appears not to cover this) and additional £48 cover that I took out that now involves a lengthy claim to recover the onward travel after landing 2 hours 37 minutes late. It took me a further 6 hours to get home after a 10 hour+ flight. I suffered lower leg cramps overnight probably from sitting in the plane for so long. The claim procedures for AIG are lengthy and aimed NOT to pay out from what I have experienced to date. Probably not worth my time or stress. Overall a very bad day returning to the UK.

17/3/24 Having read some of the AIG reviews and added my own I decided not to make any claim. The scores are very low for AIG and some appalling stories. Why would a generally good airline like Emirates associate with such a company? I will rely on my Credit Card insurance in future. They pay out.

05/04/24 No response whatsoever from an Airline I have used for 25 years. It used to aim to achieve on time arrivals if not departures, but clearly the only concern was to arrive less than 3 hours late so no compensation was due? Maybe I am being cynical? I can't recall the last on-time departure. I wonder how many other of the almost 500 passengers suffered that day with missed connections, disrupted travel and not even an apology from the Pilot?

If the company were really interested in customer relations they would be asking for my skywards number and responding to this in the time it has been posted - almost a month.

20/4/24 I still have no response from Emirates but note after similar but heavier rain and disruption they have apologized publicly. Clearly what I experienced was a foretaste of how inadequate storm drain provision is at a major international airport regardless of how infrequent the risk is, it is not catered for at all.

What To Expect Emirates march 2024

Upon boarding at the front of aircraft in Manchester, the crew were pre-emptive & helpful , I & others appreciated the customer passenger interaction.

Ohhhh, 2.5hrs into flight Ek018 before any service at seat 76H,
No face clothes/ refreshing wipes, no bar service or light snack.

Starter -Al dente potatoes & sweetcorn, bread roll. boring, what happened? No dressings you will only eat if you 'need' to, so.probably after your main course.

Main
Whlst savouring the aroma & watching passengers seated across the aisle D to G enjoy their food choice & drinks. Sadly it was unavailable for myself & all others in rear cabin seats H to K. I shall avoid these seats upon the return flight.
The Butter chicken & rice looked good & smelt appetising.
Yup i was super-deflated when i got Mince & mash, shepherd's pie? appalling, boring, bland, i asked for salt pepper, no? Apparently with the cutlery??? No.
Main course :-
avoid the mince & mash
No vegetables or salad on offer.

So far, no fresh food, only a cheap tasteless reheated luke warm offering of processed junk food for me.

As a comparison i can only think school meals from 40+ years ago or hospital food,
Ie:- a smooth paste with no texture, would work well for any one going to have turkey teeth or if you're completely toothless.

What was it that smelt so good after my 'insulting edible crap' that the cabin crew had??
Pasta? Chicken? I only saw creamy scauce leftover with real broccoli! And wiith a mega deep slice of Cheesecake.
Maybe from business or 1st class menu?
Well the curtains were tightly shut but I did get a quick peek.

Dessert, yes, a small portion in a dish of cheescake (not the same visually) pleased to say - tasty & enjoyable fortunately. Will not help much in satiating you, however & it will lift your calorie intake.

Cheese & biscuits, 2 small crackers, the remains of butter from your bread roll & a typical individual portion of cheese, yeah, ok.

Coffee/tea, I passed.

So for the Manchester Dubai flight at 13.10 fl that's your lot until tomorrow as landing at 12.25am the following morning, breakfast is your next meal.

As that's the main daytime flight, what can you expect on an early morning or evening flight?

How things have declined in service from previous experiences. Shocked.

OK the aircraft is heaps better than jet2 easy jet & ryanair, it is in a different league 5☆, but the service, No.

Cabin temperature Manchester to Dubai, ok, wearing a polo-neck mid weight cable jumper & trousers, fortunately i had socks, which were needed.

Bathrooms clean & fresh throughout whole flight with adequate rolls, tissues, paper towels & toiletries.

ICE Excellent, variety, quality, impressive, really happy!
But why after Emirates have invested so much in technology & aircraft can't we pre-order main dish before flight?

Blanket &:pillow, earphones still available.
Seats in economy spacious, nice & comfy, this was an A380.

Cabin crew member on the trolley service for the main meal, was cursory, lacked social skills, oblivious & neglient.
Leaving seat & asking at crew area for additional drinks & ice, pleasantly given.


Instead of previous breakfast service before arrival, the 2nd trolley service is a beverage & small tub of vanilla icecream.
As a petite female, I'm hungry!

I will seriously review the ££ cost of competitors even if it entails a stopover before making further bookings with Emirates & shall probably change my next already booked flight for another airline.
Skywards member.

Pre-booked disabled assistance not available at Emirates checkin, where I was advised by Emirates to go. So as a sole traveller I had to get myself to the opposite, far end of check-in desks for all airlines at T1.
Why!
Please advise special assistance is available before check-in & where it is.
I had phoned Emirates & asked prior to departure.

Jet2 from LBA do, but not Emirates in
Manchester.

Return flight, I will be well prepared before boarding.

gill,United Kingdom,9,"Not what they were
My first long haul since Covid - business class return H’row to Christchurch NZ, with stopovers in Dubai and Sydney.
A very mixed experience - a couple of legs were OK in terms of amenities (the bathrooms were kept clean, food service was well-organised and the wifi worked); one leg was good (happy, well-drilled cabin crew team, better food and smooth service); couple of legs were a bit grim (squabbling, snappy, condescending cabin crew, grubby bathrooms, poor food and poor service, and the wifi failed). Best thing overall? They all made a mean cocktail. And the limo service at H’row was v good. And you aren’t suffering 30 hours in economy.
The pods are ok - certainly possible to sleep (despite in my case the turbulence and unhappy toddlers). The tech is a bit lumpy and the headphones poor.
Dubai and Sydney stopovers - poor comms from crew about the where and when and a lot of trekking about. Queues for the showers and rather miserable catering.
It didn’t used to be like this. It’s obviously become a ‘volume’ operation - pack in as many economy refuseniks who are willing to take the wallet hit as you can. And don’t expect the ‘treat’ it used to be - just be grateful that you stand a slightly better chance of being work-ready when you stagger off your return flight.

Jerzy Strugalski,Poland,1,"Worst consumer service in case of problems. Avoid EMIRATES
Our BKK-DBX flight was delayed for 18 hours and as a result we missed our DBX-WAW connecting flight. We were offered a long flight with one more transfer DBX-LJU - WAW no longer on Emirates and FlyDubai on budget airlines where the standard was far below expectations ( no food or drink we paid for... sorry, water was given/ if you wanted you would have to pay extra!!!). Unfortunately, because of Emirates we also missed the next transfer and instead of 16 hours our journey lasted over 60 hours. The worst thing is that the Emirates hotline showed no interest in our problems. We personally had to nervously look for connections to WAW. I filed a complaint, but Emirates did not respond. They awarded bonus miles instead, but I never want to use Emirates again.
It is certainly not a premium airline which shows absolutely no interest to problems of their passengers and to their misconduct.
I feel robbed. If I had been focused on low price, not taking service / comfort / time of journey, I would have chosen some different airline paying less. Yet, I paid much, much more and I got absolutely long journey, poor service,absolute disrespect from Emirates hotline, and no refund......OK, they gave me worthless bonus miles

Steve,United Kingdom,37,"Why is Emirates customer service so bad?
We've just returned from our holiday to Vietnam.

We pre-purchased our seats 12 months ago because my wife suffers from a medical condition and need seats with leg room. 12 hours before departure we checked in online to see our seats had been changed and we were at opposite ends if the plane.

We contacted customer service and tried to get seats that were at least together and were told to reclaim the money we paid for our original seats.

We arrived back a month ago and this still ongoing without a refund even though we have complained and filled every form they've asked us to.

First I complained about the lack of notice we were given, 24 hours. They said they don't have a computer program that tells customers if their seat is changed.

Then I complained that my wife had such an uncomfortable 7.5 hour flight because of her medical condition in a seat that wasn't suitable and not the same type as the one we purchased to be shot down and told it was.

Then I filled the two separate forms out for the refund of our seats for them to be rejected because of the incorrect ticket numbers Emirates customer service had themselves told us to put on the forms! I've jyst filled both forms out again to get an email to say it'll be 15 working days, three weeks, to get our refund for a problem we didn't create! Almost two months! Unbelievable.

I onced claimed money back from British Airways fir a cancelled flight and that literally took 5 minutesvand got my refund within a couple of days.

My impression of Emirates is they have zero empathy for their customers and try to make ut as difficult as possible to claim refunds in the hope you'll give up.

Not how I'd expected to be treated by an airline ranked 4th best in the world!

By all means book your flight with Emirates.

Gabriella,United Kingdom,1,"DO NOT USE THIS AIRLINE!!!
Awful. I would not recommend anyone with a family to fly with this airline. Not one flight assistant helped us for the duration of the flight. We were completely ignored , even when requesting water to make the babies bottles. I would call for assistance numerous times and no one would come out to help. One of my twins wouldn't settle at the beginning of the flight and wouldn't stop crying. One of the flight attenders rudley told me to go to the other side as I was causing a distress for all the other passengers around me. I felt very victimised and disrespected. Every time one of my twins dropped a toy on the floor we were given filthy looks and the toys were rudely thrown back at us. We felt very discriminated because people were under the assumption that we were a lesbian couple with twin boys. Which is definitely not the case. We both married with husbands. That being said, no matter what sexual orientation one is, there should be no tolerance against discrimination.

I am aware that the flight attendants cannot help with luggage but we had absolutely no assistance in at least holding the babies while getting our luggage in the overhead. This happened on all of our flights.

There is a particular flight attendant on the second flight to Cape Town with blonde hair who made our trip very uncomfortable. She was calling her co-worker laughing and discussing us over the phone and in the kitchen and gave us dirty looks for the entire flight. I unfortunately didn't get her name but surely that is not acceptable and I would like to report her.

Emirates lost my pram which caused a huge amount of stress when arriving in London. I was not able to get through customs because I had no capacticy to carry 2 screaming babies and all my luggage so I basically sat in the middle of the airport crying my eyes out because I did not know what to do. Even after begging for help, not one person from emirates(ground staff) would assist. No one took responsibility for losing my pram and causing such a huge inconvenience. Eventually I was told that they found my pram, which was left in Dubai and I should wait another 4 hours until it gets delivered. Of which I responded absolutely not. By this time we had been travelling over 19 hours and were extremely exhausted.

The bassinets provided were disgusting. Not even my dog would sleep in that.

Overall this was the most awful, stressful experience of my life. My mental health has been affected immensely and I now have no courage to ever fly with my family again.

Initially, I was enticed to book directly due to a promised price match that was never honored, to absolute chaos whilst trying to board, to a 2.5 hour wait time for food and drinks, along with a 40-minute delay leaving the plane at our connecting flight, leaving us with less than 10 minutes to make our connection, with no assistance provided by the airline staff.

Boarding the plane, both in Manchester, Dubai, and Manilla: they divide the queues into different zones, which in theory is a great idea, but poorly executed due to signs for each zone being right at the front of each queue at chest level; hence until you're almost at the front, you have no idea what's happening from behind.

The flight from Manchester to Dubai, and coming back from Dubai to Manchester on their A380 (2 floors) - staff are incredibly friendly and genuinely trying their best, but ridiculously understaffed. 2-hour wait for food/drinks on the outward flight. Return flight 2.5 hours: not acceptable.

On arrival in Dubai, we landed late, with a further wait on the tarmac for a parking bay. Resulting in an overall 40-minute delay; leaving less than 15 minutes to connect to the next Emirates flight at the other side of Dubai airport. Again, poor service given there was nobody to help us get to the next gate despite a less than 15-minute gap. Luckily, I'm a fast runner, and the connecting Emirates flight was also delayed.

Based on this experience, which ranks as one of my worst in over 50 international flights, I would not recommend flying with them again. Recommendations for anyone who must book with them: book via a 3rd party site: it's cheaper. Avoid flying their A380 at all costs, but if you have no option, make sure to book a seat situated middle of the plane where food and drinks are initially served - avoid the very front or back unless you're okay waiting +2 hours for food/drink service.",,,avoid terrible experience from start to finish terrible experience from start to finish initially i was enticed to book directly due to a promised price match that was never honored to absolute chaos whilst trying to board to a hour wait time for food and drinks along with a minute delay leaving the plane at our connecting flight leaving us with less than minutes to make our connection with no assistance provided by the airline staff boarding the plane both in manchester dubai and manilla they divide the queues into different zones which in theory is a great idea but poorly executed due to signs for each zone being right at the front of each queue at chest level hence until you re almost at the front you have no idea what s happening from behind the flight from manchester to dubai and coming back from dubai to manchester on their a floors staff are incredibly friendly and genuinely trying their best but ridiculously understaffed hour wait for food drinks on the outward flight return flight hours not acceptable on arrival in dubai we landed late with a further wait on the tarmac for a parking bay resulting in an overall minute delay leaving less than minutes to connect to the next emirates flight at the other side of dubai airport again poor service given there was nobody to help us get to the next gate despite a less than minute gap luckily i m a fast runner and the connecting emirates flight was also delayed based on this experience which ranks as one of my worst in over international flights i would not recommend flying with them again recommendations for anyone who must book with them book via a rd party site it s cheaper avoid flying their a at all costs but if you have no option make sure to book a seat situated middle of the plane where food and drinks are initially served avoid the very front or back unless you re okay waiting hours for food drink service ,-0.8794,Negative,Cabin Crew

Sujith Thulaseedharan,Germany,1,"Disappointing Experience with Emirates: Lack of Wheelchair Assistance and Miscommunication
I booked a ticket with Emirates for around 2000 euros from COK to HAM approximately three months before the travel date for my parents. As my father is sick and they were new to air travel, I also booked wheelchair assistance for them. One day before the travel date, I contacted Emirates customer care, and they informed me that wheelchair assistance could only be provided if it was available at the airport on the travel date. Unfortunately, this information was not communicated to me at the time of booking.
My parents began their journey from COK, but they did not receive any assistance from Emirates employees. In such cases, I expected that some staff members would be able to assist them. Upon reaching DXB, they finally received wheelchair assistance, but here's where the problem occurred. My parents needed to travel to Hamburg from Dubai, but the Emirates staff dropped them off at the Singapore Airlines gate. Fortunately, they overheard other passengers mentioning the country name and checked the monitor to discover the error. Since my parents are not fluent in English, I had booked wheelchair assistance for them. Eventually, they found an airport staff member, who happened to be a sweeper, and he helped them find the correct gate.
Upon reaching Hamburg airport, there was no wheelchair assistance available. If Emirates cannot arrange proper wheelchair service, they should clearly mention this during the booking process.

Terrible airline to deal with when it comes to cancellations within 24 hours for US citizens/residents. Unlike most airlines, which you can call and cancel with an agent or cancel via their website, Emirates is banking on you making mistakes when filling out their form which will not be processed until a week later.

As anticipated by them, my lack of experience using their form, I fell right into their trap, and when I thought I was cancelling the entire reservation, Lo and behold, I missed the tiny + sign to add a second ticket # for my 2 year old. Emirates ran with that and did not cancel my 2 year old ticket at the same time as my ticket. Someone please explain how is this allowed to leave a 2 year old ticket active without the adult companion ??? When I inquired about it I received a response ( 1 week after cancellation), I was told that since I requested the cancellation for her ticket later, they would apply the ticket cancellation terms based on a cancellation request made 1 week after purchase.

My elderly (78 & 68), non-tech parents travelled on Emirates. Check-in is fully automated now and they only wanted passengers to queue up to use the machines. This included carrying luggage onto the scales. My family and I went to send them off.

When I asked to accompany my parents to the machine (literally on the other side of a rope) so I could help load the luggage, the staff refused to allow it. They essentially implied that my parents should do it by themselves.

There were FOUR staff members who were all just standing in a circle gossiping amongst themselves while my parents struggled with both the luggage and the machines. In the end, I disregarded the staff and popped over to the other side of the rope to help them. The staff were too busy gossiping to notice I had gone over to help anyway.

Why does Emirates even have staff when they do absolutely nothing at the check-in? Unprofessional and a waste of time, space and money. The job is not exactly rocket science.

JR,United Kingdom,5,"No consideration for life threatening nut allergy
I would have given 0 stars if that was an option.
I am deeply dissatisfied with the service provided by Emirates. After booking flights from the UK to Japan via Dubai for our family, and therefore choosing inflight meals, we were alarmed by the lack of consideration and accommodations for passengers with serious nut allergies. Our son has a life threatening nut allergy (not a life choice) requiring an Epi pen but Emirates failed to offer any nut free options. We then researched more and found out that they would not stop serving nuts onboard neither would they ask other passengers not to bring nuts onto the plane, thereby putting our son’s life at risk. In this day and age, how is this acceptable? We have flown with other airlines and not had a problem at all, they have been more than willing to ensure our son’s and other passengers safety. In response to this serious concern, we promptly asked Emirates within three hours of booking, to cancel. However, we were shocked to be met with an exorbitant £800 cancellation fee, despite explaining the seriousness of our situation. We asked to escalate this to a Manager and were told this wasn’t possible. We have since sent two email complaints and Emirates have shown a disappointing lack of empathy by refusing to waive the fee/alter their policies. This stance stands in stark contrast to the policies of other airlines, which prioritise passenger safety and offer leniency in similar circumstances. It is unacceptable that Emirates priorities profit over the well-being of its customers, leaving us feeling both disregarded and financially burdened. In addition to this, if our flight had originated in the USA, we would have been able to cancel with no fees irrelevant of the reason.

Nightmare at 30,000 Feet: My Emirates experience was horrific, starting at Delhi airport where ground staff threatened to deny boarding unless I forced my laptop into my carry-on.

Laptop Damage: Compromising, I stowed my laptop in the trolley, resulting in scratches and screen damage. Boarding pass retrieval led to another confrontation at the gate.

Boarding Pass Snatching: Emirates staff at the gate confiscated my boarding passes, threatened baggage offloading, and harassed me for carrying my laptop bag separately.

Last-Minute Boarding: Only after pledging to stow my laptop bag under my seat was I allowed to board just before departure.

Lost Luggage Saga: Upon reaching LA, I discovered a missing bag, possibly held by ground staff as revenge. It took days for Emirates to locate it.

Midnight Intrusion: Emirates staff, without notice or gate codes, knocked at midnight, delivering my damaged bag. How they accessed it remains a mystery.

Bag Damage and stolen items: The bag was torn, belongings damaged, and some items were missing. Despite three complaints, Emirates provided no response.

Customer Service Failure: Emirates' lack of response to my complaints further deepened the ordeal, leaving me without any resolution or acknowledgment.

Unanswered Queries: Despite reaching out multiple times, Emirates offered no explanations, leaving me frustrated and dissatisfied with their customer service.

Terrible customer service from Eslam. I will be in touch again tomorrow, and hope that it will be better and resolved. Booked our entire trip's flights through the Emirates website from Bali to London. We paid the extra money to have this security and felt confident with a smooth trip home.

Our first short flight, they booked with their partner company, Jetstar followed by 2 long Emirates flights. This first flight has been delayed and I was looking for some reassurance that if we miss our connecting flight due to the tight turnaround they would assist. They continued for an hour to say that the flight has not been delayed as they have not been updated, so they cannot do anything. Jetstar (reminder, their partner company) I had on another chat, was happy to talk to them if they contact them on our behalf. As they booked the flight, they were unable to speak with us directly. Seemed an easy fix - WRONG - Emirates will not contact the airline or help in any way. They say they do not contact Jetstar, which is bizarre as all over the website it is advertising 'Jetstar - Asia Partnership'. Partners are meant to communicate? A quick call could have sorted everything.

The Customer Service was full of templates just being copy and pasted. It was absolutely appalling. Eslam was not listening to any of my concerns or helping in any way at all.

One hour before landing the cabin crew start clearing up throughout the cabin which means that there was less than 3 hours time of reduced disturbance on the flight .My advice is do not book travel in business class on A 380s you are better of flying economy and saving money. Our impression was that we were located in the middle of a very busy train station.
Emirates no longer provides a wash bag with some basic items such as toothpaste ,toothbrush , lip balm and the like and further more printed on our boarding pass was NO ACCESS to their lounge - and that is the first time in my experience that I have travelled in business and was denied any lounge access.

UNBELIEVABLE EXPERIENCE ACROSS 4 FLIGHTS
NFFT26.

If things go wrong, that's when you discover just how good or bad any company is. There is NO telephone number to discuss issues - Email only, with a self generated 30 Day response. Emailed on 1st December,2023 as I write 2nd January 2024 No response received. Below are my 2 Emails in addition to completing claim form, as any Credit Card company require the customer to allow the merchant the opportunity to resolve in the first instance. :-

Holiday of a lifetime for both myself and wife to celebrate our 60th birthdays, saved for over the past 5 yrs.

Emirates chosen, flights and seats (extra £532) - Didn't actually sit in any of them on any leg.

Emirates changed aircraft on Leg 1 - didn't inform myself that our seats had been changed from two together in economy class on upper deck.

Leg 2 - in light of above, with my wife being upset and not being able to sit just the two of us, I paid another additional £1,230 for business class.

Leg 3 - just allocated random seats, again not what we had paid for.

Leg 4 - were actually finally allocated the correct seats we had paid for HOWEVER, having sat on the aircraft for over 2hrs everyone was offloaded back into the airport, having received no less than 8 emails stating different departure times. My wife by this time was very unwell and unable to walk very far.
A further Email offering complementary refreshments at restricted outlets, with restricted menu was then received, we were unable to partake of any of these. The airport was is chaos with no one knowing what was actually happening. Eventually we boarded another aircraft some 8 hrs after our scheduled departure, allocated random seats again !

I work for the British Government in Community Safety , Trading Standards , Competition and Markets Legislation and whilst European aviation EASA and CAA applies to certain situations, I would expect the highest of standards from Emirates.

Consequently within 48 hrs of arriving back in the United Kingdom, I received a further Email from Emirates (without prejudice) crediting both my wife's and my Sky rewards with 40000 air miles.

I very much look forward to all the relevant refunds and compensation from Emirates shortly, as United Kingdom relevant legislation requires the complainant to seek remedy with the merchant in the first instance, which should be undertaken promptly and fairly.

Should you require further information, don't hesitate to contact myself directly on the below contact telephone number.

1764202008068 Mrs Deborah Shakespeare

Please view my below complaints with regards to our recent and only experience with Emirates, over 4 legs between Manchester Uk and Thailand, via Dubai.

All four legs of journey encountered problems, with not one leg going according to plan.

We booked our holiday of a lifetime seven months in advance and in respect of Emirates paid for specific seating on those four legs, costing an additional £532.00 GBP. We were not allocated any of our pre-paid seats on any of the four legs.

In order that our holiday start was not ruined, I even paid an additional £1,230 for Business class on our 2nd leg to Thailand as due to operational matters the aircraft was changed.

Our final leg from Dubai to Manchester, resulted in all passengers being offloaded to a aircraft fault and a subsequent delay of nearly 8 hrs.

I understand that things can go wrong, however our experience of all four flights must surely be exceptional, we are both in our 60s and my wife suffers ill health with her legs.

I have submitted the below claim, via Emirates website, having originally being informed that someone from customer services would contact myself, (this apparently is incorrect advice from the Emirates advisor)

I can be contacted directly on +44 7984189289 should you require further information.

We arrived at the airport and found out my carer was not allowed to board the flight and we missed. I contacted webjet and told them what had happening and was advised that we were non show. Non show is a lie we were denied entry to catch a connecting flight to Sydney. and were trying to charge us a non show fee. Which i could not afford at the time , so we spent 2 days at airport and could not have decency to allow us to get back to Australia and lost $2800 .

We flew Emirates from Krabi to Birmingham.

The actual Emirates plane on the second leg - service, space, food, entertainment was great as always.

BUT the first leg Krabi to Dubai was a codeshare operated by FlyDubai, which to all purposes is an 8 hour flight on Ryanair. No entertainment, absolutely inedible meal, uncomfortable seats, cold, no free entertainment or blankets. Though cabin crew were friendly.

The (assumed) expection when booking through a reputable airline like Emirates is that an 8 hour codeshare is like for like and not a budget airline. This was not made clear (at all) on booking.

When I complained to Emirates, after one month they copied a blurb about 'terms and conditions'. Subsequent conversations (with Josh) offered no resolution or remorse, they refused to follow this up with Flydubai.

Roy Barrow,United Kingdom,8,"Why use Emirates and pay more?
I have used this airline for long haul for over 20 years now and although they are not the cheapest, previously i used them as i was totally satisfied with them. I had flown both economy and business class and was happy with the service provided. That was until after 4 years of not flying due to Covid when i decided to treat my family to a holiday in Switzerland. The flight from Bangkok to Dubai is the reason for me now deciding to use another carrier.
As a family of 4, we flew economy and i had pre-booked seats. Not long before our flights i showed my wife the seats that i had booked and she asked me why i had chosen these seats. I looked online and saw that these seats were not the seats i had booked. Emirates had changed the aircraft and the new aircraft did not have rows of 2 seats so they changed us to normal seats without telling me. The changed seats were not acceptable so i re-booked alternatives.
Some time later i lost my credit card that i had booked the flight with. I paid and was charged in UK sterling as i used my UK credit card.
When i returned from holiday i completed the online refund request form and after a long time eventually got a reply that showed that they had not read my email properly. So i tried to phone and complain but this is impossible with Emirates. You have do everything online. I was given an email for complaining so i sent them an email and actually received a prompt(ish) reply!
When i tried to reply to their reply it bounced back as a non reply email address! So back online with online forms!!
I have now been sent a promise of a refund in Thai Baht! Or should i say 4 refunds for 4 seats! They are sending the refund in Thai Baht to my UK credit card which means i will have 4 foreign currency conversion fees to pay! Not only that i have lost the card and previously reported it as stolen so it will be difficult for me to access the money, if indeed they can still send it to that card.
In short from being an airline that i have recommended for over 20 years, Emirates has gone to an airline that i warn people about.
I have been happy to pay a premium for my flights before now with Emirates. Now i have already got 7 business class travelers to look elsewhere.

I booked a one-way flight (full fare, fully flexible) via the Emirates website on my mobile phone. Two days later I tried to cancel it. In the FAQ it says ""Can I cancel my booking? Yes, you can make any changes to your booking on emirates.com through Manage your booking.""

If you follow the link on your mobile phone, there are many options to manage your booking, but none to cancel your booking. Instead they prefer to give you options to spend more money, like booking a car or a hotel.

I called the customer service who confirmed that it is not possible to cancel your booking on the mobile version of their website, and also not possible via the customer service.

Masako Ishimoto,Singapore,1,"The WORST experience with Emirates…
The worst experience with emirates airline customer service! Never believe they are one of the top 3 airline company!
I’ve purchased a ticket on 11Nov’23 with my credit card and partial miles. 2FA done and transaction was successful from both bank and emirates app. I even received a confirmation email to it with a notification that my miles were deducted. I even checked my trip with booking reference found in my app. So what more can I expect from this and how can this be a failure after all? I randomly checked and found out my booking was not processed after weeks and I called the bank and they said if 2FA confirmed, it is the airline app side issue that did not process my payment to proceed it. I did twice (2nd time was about a week ago), it never went through. I only realized after a week so today I called up the customer service and they blamed me that I should have contacted them asap if not processed but how would I know it was not successful after I saw “thank you for booking…” on the app at the end and my trip found in my app?

Khawaja,United Kingdom,4,"POOR SERVICE/ NOT RESOLVING ISSUE OF DAMAGE BAG
I am writing to express my disappointment and frustration with the handling of a recent complaint regarding the damage to my checked baggage after traveling on Emirates flight EK 603 from Karachi to London Gatwick on 05/06/2023.
Upon discovering the significant damage to my suitcase upon arrival, I promptly filed a complaint with your customer service team, outlining the details of the damage and providing supporting documentation. Regrettably, I have yet to receive a satisfactory resolution to this matter.
Additionally, I was surprised to be asked for the receipt of the used bag. Unfortunately, I was not aware in advance that the airline would require such documentation, and therefore, I did not retain the original receipt for the bag.

Nikolai Ishchenko,United States,1,"Don't fly with Emirates
On the night of November 26th to 27th, my wife with children was supposed to fly from Dubai International Airport (DXB) to Mexico for the New Year holidays. Hotels and children's entertainment were booked and paid for through Booking, Airbnb, and other services. At the check-in counter, Emirates Airlines security personnel turned them away without providing any reasons, and they were not allowed to check in luggage or board the flight. Yesterday, before the plane departed, I spent 2 hours on the phone trying to explain to the airline staff that such actions are unacceptable and it is illegal to deny passengers boarding without explanation, especially considering my wife has been to several countries, including Mexico. There have never been any problems with other airlines. But that's just the first part of the story.

Yesterday, after the plane left without my wife and children, I tried to communicate with the airline staff through their website chat. I inquired about a full refund. They replied that I needed to wait (probably until the plane lands in Mexico), wait until they receive a response from their security service, and then I can request a refund, but not a full one – as they put it, an ""honest"" refund. Seriously? An ""honest"" refund? My wife waited for 3 hours with our 3-year-old daughter in her arms just to get through registration and board the plane! I want to make it clear that I will post reviews everywhere possible, and I won't remove them until a full refund is issued with an apology. They ruined all our New Year holidays with their rules. Also, they exit the chat with a slick phrase like, ""Oh, we see that you've stepped away, so we're ending the chat, but feel free to contact us with any questions 24/7.""

11 of us travelled on Emirates from Bham to Dubai/Sydney 28 October 23 and returned 16 Nov back into Bham EK0039 flight.

We paid for extra leg room seats 80J K H so that we could relax and have sleep on the long journeys ahead of us.

On 3 of the trips the air stewards were respectful of our space, given we were next to where they served the food and drinks with their trolleys. They were all quiet during the long flights once drinks and food had been served so myself, husband and son could sleep.
However, on the flight from Dubai to Bham this could not be a worse experience if Emirates tried. The team were inexperienced (bar one professional) one of them swearing so we could hear F""** word as the curtains were left open, explaining what she required in men. The food and drinks trolley was left next to my husband within an inch of his feet so they stepped over him each time, apologising for waking him up over the next 3 hours. A team of 6 stood in our area having a meeting.
After 4 hours into the 8 hr flight, I politely asked if they could move the trolley so we were not disturbed and it was really disrespectful given we had paid extra for the seat.

Absolutely astonished with the service!
Frustrated and simply distinguished.
Very poor online service, been on calls with emirates for several hours to do simple changes for my booking, English level of them wishes the best for their customers.
But that wouldn't be a huge problem if there wouldn't be IF.
Long story short, it has all started when me and my wife decided to upgrade to business, as we were flying to our honeymoon. So we did that. Then, what appears- we can't reserve our seats as it's BUSINESS LITE, which has never been mentioned on the website. Ok, we take that as well, as we don't want to mix negative emotions with our honeymoon vacation.
We're waiting 48h before the flight and checking in (thanks god) next to each other.
We're boarding to the plane and what's next? The next words I hear is "" Sorry,we're out of seafood and fish"" GUYS , THE PLANE JUST HAS TAKEN OFF and we're in business class, the middle of it. So my wife is fully allergic to any kind of pastry, meat or dairy, we're asking what could we do. They can't offer nothing. What I'm doing next, I'm trying to order prawn salad for me(I'm allergic to fish, kinda sarcasm) and give it to her, on which they're saying - ok. We're waiting another 30 min to receive the information that they're out of this salad as well.

So if we simply sum it up :
-Extremely bad online service
-Extremely bad on plane management
-No salvation for customer satisfaction
-Changed flight for 2 days(forgot to mention that in main text)
- None of compensations, nothing

I tried to book 2 business class tickets online on 14 Nov 23 for £8863. After authorising payment with my bank, the Emirates system froze and i was told by their website to call the sales centre by clicking on a red button. I thought i was dealing directly with Emirates. Instead a rep at Flights Journey/Times Travel, Emirates' sales partner, who said he was from Emirates, booked me seats at £9,500 as he said there were no flights left at the lower price. Then the next day he charged me another £375 to add our middle names to the booking (which I was not asked for at the time of booking). On 16 Nov 23, £8863 came out of my account resulting on me having 2 bookings (4 tickets). I have tried to cancel the booking as the error was with Emirates booking system, but was told in the online chat with Emirates that it would cost me £1,200!! This is for an error with Emirates system, which froze and directed me to rip off merchants. This was not my fault and I am currently out of pocket by £18,738 rather than £8,863. The agent rep said he would try to get me a refund directly from Emirates for the £8,863 which i have not yet received. He then tried to bill me again for £400 to select seats on the flight. I told him seat selection is free in Business Class so he then asked me to send him £100 to his personal bank account for helping me, which I refused to do.

Sepideh Moussavi,United Kingdom,4,"Mr Dragan; The Cabin Crew Member Who Made a Difference
Mr Dragan! This review is about this gentleman. One of the cabin crews (maybe the head, I am not sure!) on my flight back to London. I underwent a spinal surgery in Dubai and booked a wheelchair since I was strongly advised not to walk/ stand for more than 10 minutes at the time with 30 minutes breaks. I did not have a great experience with ground staff especially for the wheelchair. I ended up walking to the gate therefore I was in serious pain when I reached the plane. At the time of check in, I requested a front seat since I kept having to stretch my legs to release pain from my spine. I was told only the cabin crew members on the plane can do that since those seats are reserved (basically cost an extra 400AED). As I entered the plane, I requested a crew member to help with allocating a seat and I was told that he cannot since these are paid seats. I presented my medical report from my surgeon and I was so lucky that Mr Dragan was standing there. The crew member then asked this gentleman and without any delays he looked at my condition and medical spine brace I was wearing and didn't think twice to allow it, making my trip much easier. I was obviously in agonising pain but the last thing you need in such situation is worrying about disturbing all the people sitting next to you and having to continuously ask them to allow you out etc. These are some people and moments that in today's world are becoming rarer and rarer, sadly. However when we experience them, I think it is important to appreciate these still-remained-humans so it can encourage and inspire others to be like them. It really doesn't take much to be nice or to express empathy. It is on the hand so easy to say No, without considering what that simple two letter word can do to a person! In our capitalist world, when money is involved, it's so easy to forget that we are human first! This is not even money going out of airline staff or crew members pocket. So how wonderful would it be if all crew members could be more like Mr Dragan. I express my utmost gratitude to this gentleman for your kindness, empathy and care. You are the type of person who is making a difference and making this world a better place!

Nigel Hogarth,Australia,1,"Misleading Information in Booking Process
I recently went on the Emirates Web Chat site to see if I could change the dates of previously booked flights to Adelaide.
The Customer Service Representative was very good and was able to give me a number of options for new dates to travel. We discussed this over 40 minutes and then he changed my trip from this November 2023 to March 2024. He asked me if my credit card was already stored on my Emirates Profile and when I replied no, he gave me the telephone number of the credit card payment here in Australia to pay the chsnge fee of $25 per ticket. As the flights were only one way, I went to another airline on the Web and booked the return flights to correspond with my new dates. Later, I rang to pay for Emirates flights and was told that the changes were invalid as the tickets could not be changed for the following year. However, when I went to my Emirates Skywards Miles Page, the change in flight date was already there.
The Emirates Customer Service Representative explained over the phone that obviously the previous Representative had made a mistake and they would have to contact an internal Emirates Department to ask to honour the new booking. I was told that they would call me back later.
I waited that day for the call and recieved nothing. I then decided to contact them again on their chat site to see what was going on - obviously I was stressing as I had booked other associated flights and was concerned.
I eventually connected with an agent who basically said that my ticket could not be changed and I would need to cancel it for $75 and start again. There was no sorry sir, we made a mistake. It was quite direct and this would be my only option. I had to comment that maybe being apologetic about the mistake would be appropriate and the Representative gave me a pathetic apology but would not take an responsibility for the incorrect information that I had been given.
That night, I tried to write a complaint but the Emirates Website will only class it as Feedback if you have not done the travel. I did write the feedback and said it was an official complaint as I believe supplying incorrect information is not acceptable in Australian Consumer Law.
I later contacted Emirates later by their Messenger Page and basically got another Representative who steered the conversation away from the booking Representative making a mistake. It was an incorrect change and I had to suffer the consequence. She said that the date changes that I could see on my Skyward Miles Page were only temporary and I should check the real electronic ticket which had not been changed. I replied that these changes showed in the "" manage your booking "" Page and to me were real. In the end, I finished the conversation as it was obvious that no body in Emirates wanted to accept responsibility for the mistake made by their agent. It has cost me a lot of time on the phone including worry and stress.
I am very surprised that when their agents make mistakes, they will not accept and responsibility. It basically my problem and hardly an apology which I find quite amazing from an Airline that boasts about their amazing brand.",,11/2/2023,misleading information in booking process i recently went on the emirates web chat site to see if i could change the dates of previously booked flights to adelaide the customer service representative was very good and was able to give me a number of options for new dates to travel we discussed this over minutes and then he changed my trip from this november to march he asked me if my credit card was already stored on my emirates profile and when i replied no he gave me the telephone number of the credit card payment here in australia to pay the chsnge fee of per ticket as the flights were only one way i went to another airline on the web and booked the return flights to correspond with my new dates later i rang to pay for emirates flights and was told that the changes were invalid as the tickets could not be changed for the following year however when i went to my emirates skywards miles page the change in flight date was already there the emirates customer service representative explained over the phone that obviously the previous representative had made a mistake and they would have to contact an internal emirates department to ask to honour the new booking i was told that they would call me back later i waited that day for the call and recieved nothing i then decided to contact them again on their chat site to see what was going on obviously i was stressing as i had booked other associated flights and was concerned i eventually connected with an agent who basically said that my ticket could not be changed and i would need to cancel it for and start again there was no sorry sir we made a mistake it was quite direct and this would be my only option i had to comment that maybe being apologetic about the mistake would be appropriate and the representative gave me a pathetic apology but would not take an responsibility for the incorrect information that i had been given that night i tried to write a complaint but the emirates website will only class it as feedback if you have not done the travel i did write the feedback and said it was an official complaint as i believe supplying incorrect information is not acceptable in australian consumer law i later contacted emirates later by their messenger page and basically got another representative who steered the conversation away from the booking representative making a mistake it was an incorrect change and i had to suffer the consequence she said that the date changes that i could see on my skyward miles page were only temporary and i should check the real electronic ticket which had not been changed i replied that these changes showed in the manage your booking page and to me were real in the end i finished the conversation as it was obvious that no body in emirates wanted to accept responsibility for the mistake made by their agent it has cost me a lot of time on the phone including worry and stress i am very surprised that when their agents make mistakes they will not accept and responsibility it basically my problem and hardly an apology which i find quite amazing from an airline that boasts about their amazing brand ,-0.9719,Negative,Cabin Crew

This was my first time flying with Emirates and I was given so many recommendations to fly with them so I am shocked.

Hardly any of the stewards greeted anyone in EC on 3 occasions I would make eye contact and smile and you would get nothing back from them.

When I did ask for a drink the stewards make you feel like you should not be asking.

I sat on a six hour flight and by the time I was getting off I was so dehydrated.

I completely understand that when you purchase a ticket the treatment your get will be different in every class. But just being polite I think would be standard across the board.

That's a load of sh...t. the drink was served once and no more on the entire plane, half of the food was inedible. The cleanliness of the toilets is questionable, but it is certain that they are not clean. Emirates is starting to look like Wizz Air. You will soon have to pay for food, like a low-cost airline. And between Dubai and London, the flight attendants told us everything, A 2-year-old child cannot lie down without a seat belt, we asked for an extender, and they said that it is not recommended for people over the age of two, and then they even gave it to us at our own risk. also a single meal on a 7.5-hour journey. The portions are getting smaller and smaller, I would say there was a second meal but no... The bun was so hard that if I hit someone in the head with it, they would faint. Rock hard.

I booked a return trip from Manchester to Bangkok. I was a bit shocked as to how much the prices have increased. I like flying the A380 so went ahead and booked. I also payed extra to pre-book my seats, which in my opinion is a rip off if you are paying over £800 for a flight.

Rude staff, delays, dirty airplanes, terrible food. I booked the flights after seeing emirates looked nice on tv. After we got lots of donations I upgraded us to premium seating. Once I got the tickets I noticed it was only for 1/4 of the flights. This certainly was not clear when booking. I called them and a rude lady told me it was clear and would not help me with anything. It was over £1500 for the upgrade which with virgin is the usual cost for 10 hour flight both ways. I then emailed in and got the same attitude. In the end I asked to pay to upgrade my flights and never heard back to me.

Emirates discriminate against packaged tour passengers

Several records were broken for me as a flight passenger on Emirates in 2 days. First I was separated from my wife of 35 years and then despite my plea of a stiff shoulder I was given a window seat in all my 42 years of flying.

Emirates seem to treat its tour group passengers as 2nd class passengers without any rights.
My wife and I flew to Spain and Portugal from Singapore on a packaged tour with a travel group.

On our return flights first from Madrid to Dubai on EK142 on 9 Oct 2023 and from Dubai to Singapore on EK 354 on 10 Oct 2023, my wife and I were placed on window seats on the opposite sides of the aircraft. When I enquired at the check in counter for an aisle seat for the 2 flights as I am a tall bloke with a stiff shoulder (which has been affecting me for the past 5 years), the staff gave me an aisle seat further back and my wife in a window seat 6 rows ahead.

She said she tried but could not see the connecting flight seating plan from Dubai to Singapore and advised me to approach the boarding gate in Dubai for help.

When we reached Dubai, the tour manager, my wife and I, another another couple who had been in opposite ends of the aircraft made a beeline for the connecting help desk close to B18 boarding gate.
The guard refused to let us into the queue even though there was no one queuing and the 2 counter staff were helping a couple of the passengers at the counter.

He told us to use the self-help kiosk computer even though we said we needed help with changing the seats. The computer did not do the latter and directed back to the counter.

The guard was still reluctant and finally allowed my wife and I in the queue. However, our tour manager and the couple were kept outside the line even though they had legitimate business to speak to someone at the counter.

There was a couple talking to a group of the staff outside the counter near the queue and the man was gesticulating wildly in a heated discussion with the staff. Eventually one of the staff involved in the 'conversation' told the guard to admit all of us and 'royally allowed' us to talk to him behind the counter.

He told us in no uncertain terms that we were given our seats as 'non-paying' passengers and it was tough luck that we had to be separated. Our tour manager protested that the tour passenger list with familial/partnering connections was given to the airline beforehand but he said we were given a block of seats from rows 81 to 83 and he could not help in any way.

My question to the airline is this: if the passenger list has been provided with the different familial/partnering groupings could it not be more accommodating and doing a slipshod job of seating willy nilly without regard for the families and couples travelling together. What happens if there are families with young children? Furthermore if the airline has given a block of seats (say rows 61 to 63 or 81 to 83 and not all window seats or not all middle seats) in advance why can't it have the good sense to pass them on the tour manager beforehand so the tour manager can help to allocate the seats according to the passengers' preference and needs? Even in times of profit squeeze when corporations try to extract every cent from its passengers, how much money can you make to justify discriminating/alienating your passengers just because the 25 of them are travelling as part of a package tour? Would it make more sense to block up say 3 rows of seats when the tour company has booked and confirmed with the airline if the tour is going ahead (package tours are usually confirmed 2 weeks ahead of departure). Why make packaged tour passengers scramble for seats and create all that unhappiness for them against the airline?

I am really disappointed with Emirates as I used to fly Emirates between Australia and Singapore. As much I deem its cabin crew to be on par with the best in the industry, its booking and check in handling do leave such a bad taste that I feel like a sub passenger to want to boycott the airline.",,10/9/2023,emirates discriminate against packaged emirates discriminate against packaged tour passengers several records were broken for me as a flight passenger on emirates in days first i was separated from my wife of years and then despite my plea of a stiff shoulder i was given a window seat in all my years of flying emirates seem to treat its tour group passengers as nd class passengers without any rights my wife and i flew to spain and portugal from singapore on a packaged tour with a travel group on our return flights first from madrid to dubai on ek on oct and from dubai to singapore on ek on oct my wife and i were placed on window seats on the opposite sides of the aircraft when i enquired at the check in counter for an aisle seat for the flights as i am a tall bloke with a stiff shoulder which has been affecting me for the past years the staff gave me an aisle seat further back and my wife in a window seat rows ahead she said she tried but could not see the connecting flight seating plan from dubai to singapore and advised me to approach the boarding gate in dubai for help when we reached dubai the tour manager my wife and i another another couple who had been in opposite ends of the aircraft made a beeline for the connecting help desk close to b boarding gate the guard refused to let us into the queue even though there was no one queuing and the counter staff were helping a couple of the passengers at the counter he told us to use the self help kiosk computer even though we said we needed help with changing the seats the computer did not do the latter and directed back to the counter the guard was still reluctant and finally allowed my wife and i in the queue however our tour manager and the couple were kept outside the line even though they had legitimate business to speak to someone at the counter there was a couple talking to a group of the staff outside the counter near the queue and the man was gesticulating wildly in a heated discussion with the staff eventually one of the staff involved in the conversation told the guard to admit all of us and royally allowed us to talk to him behind the counter he told us in no uncertain terms that we were given our seats as non paying passengers and it was tough luck that we had to be separated our tour manager protested that the tour passenger list with familial partnering connections was given to the airline beforehand but he said we were given a block of seats from rows to and he could not help in any way my question to the airline is this if the passenger list has been provided with the different familial partnering groupings could it not be more accommodating and doing a slipshod job of seating willy nilly without regard for the families and couples travelling together what happens if there are families with young children furthermore if the airline has given a block of seats say rows to or to and not all window seats or not all middle seats in advance why can t it have the good sense to pass them on the tour manager beforehand so the tour manager can help to allocate the seats according to the passengers preference and needs even in times of profit squeeze when corporations try to extract every cent from its passengers how much money can you make to justify discriminating alienating your passengers just because the of them are travelling as part of a package tour would it make more sense to block up say rows of seats when the tour company has booked and confirmed with the airline if the tour is going ahead package tours are usually confirmed weeks ahead of departure why make packaged tour passengers scramble for seats and create all that unhappiness for them against the airline i am really disappointed with emirates as i used to fly emirates between australia and singapore as much i deem its cabin crew to be on par with the best in the industry its booking and check in handling do leave such a bad taste that i feel like a sub passenger to want to boycott the airline ,0.7724,Positive,Cabin Crew
Toye,United Kingdom,1,"My experience with the Emirates
The customer service is bad
My family and I had a horrible experience flying the Emirates to and from Dubai.

On this flight, my allocated seat had a broken tray. I complained to the staff, and they told me they would sort it out. However, after multiple attempts, no one assisted me. This meant that I could not eat my dinner at all.
On our way back from Dubai, due to a bad communication between the Emirates medical team and their staff at the airport, We had spent over 12 hours at Dubai International Airport with no provision or somewhere to sleep and the only form of compensation received was a food voucher. The mental trauma that Emirates inflicted on my family is beyond words. Also, I had to pay £1700 to book a different airline for myself and my 15 years old daughter back to the UK.
Now, it's over a month since I made an official complaint and till now I have not received any reply.

Niccolo,Italy,3,"Horrible experience
I wish to express my dissatisfaction with my recent experience on Emirates Flight EK2185, scheduled for August 6th, 2023, from Dubai to Catania. The flight was canceled less than 24 hours in advance, which severely impacted my long-haul trip. This trip was booked through the Emirates website and was disrupted just hours before its departure due to the cited 'unforeseen circumstances,' namely a fire incident at Catania Airport, which had occurred three weeks prior.

Being an aware passenger, I was cognizant of the previous flight cancellations to Catania and the airport's incapacity to handle extra-Schengen flights. Consequently, I had been diligently monitoring the situation, investing significant time and financial resources from a remote location in South Africa to stay updated and explore alternative travel options in case of an eventual cancellation.

My distressing experience began when I found myself caught in a bureaucratic game of ping-pong between Emirates and Flydubai, the airline operating the flight. Both carriers appeared to evade responsibility and failed to offer me any practical alternative plans. The cancellation notification reached me while I was en route to the airport, necessitating an unscheduled stop in an area with phone reception to contact the Emirates call center, as per Flydubai's app recommendation.

To my dismay, I spent over 30 minutes on the phone only to discover that Emirates was not presenting any viable options for reaching my final destination. Furthermore, their communication regarding alternative flights from Dubai to Italy was initially unclear—mentioning Rome or Milan—and later, limited to Naples, with no apparent connection to Catania. It was only after a protracted discussion that the call-center operator finally intervened, reconfiguring my entire reservation to a flight bound for Milan, just an hour before my scheduled check-in at Skukuza.

This change, which was seemingly necessitated by Emirates' arcane policies, left me in Dubai without compensation for the additional time spent there. I was accommodated in a shared room with no meals, a circumstance that I managed to secure solely because my partner already had a reservation for a Dubai Connect service. Following the call-center operator's instructions, I had to personally book a new flight from Milan to Catania, incurring additional expenses.

The overwhelming stress and uncertainty surrounding this ordeal marred a significant portion of my holiday experience. Furthermore, it resulted in illness, causing me to miss an essential medical appointment scheduled in Catania on August 7th. This entire episode proved to be nightmarish and deeply disappointing, an outcome I never anticipated from a company of Emirates' stature.

I respectfully requested that Emirates recognized the hardships I endured during this journey, including the extra costs incurred due to the days of delay and the missed medical appointment. However, they just said they could do nothing...

durai raj,United Arab Emirates,1,"Subject: My Recent Experience with Emirates Airlines
Dear Emirates Team,

I hope this mail finds you well. I want to share my current experience as a passenger on an Emirates flight from Dubai to Sri Lanka . Although I understand that arriving at the boarding gate just 15 minutes before the departure time was entirely my fault, I was disappointed with the way I was treated by your staff.

In a situation already fraught with anxiety due to a family emergency, I encountered Emirates staff who were less than empathetic. While I take responsibility for my late arrival, I believe the staff's conduct was unnecessarily harsh.

To my surprise, I was rebooked on another Emirates flight without clear communication about the change. This flight required a lengthy layover at Male Airport, which adding to the stress of my journey. I believe better communication and support could have made this transition smoother.

Additionally, I wish to address the penalties imposed for my late arrival. While I understand the importance of punctuality, I hope you can consider the circumstances that led to my tardiness.

I kindly request a review of the penalties and an evaluation of staff conduct in such situations. By doing so, Emirates Airlines can continue to provide excellent customer service and understand the unique needs of passengers during challenging times.

I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your response.

Fed up,United Kingdom,25,"Emirates have gone downhill
Having travelled with Emirates several times before it is sad to see a once brilliant airline slowly decline. When I first few with them, they were excellent. I have just returned from another holiday to Dubai and flew from Heathrow. We travelled to Heathrow from Scotland as we were looking for a better standard of plane. Sadly this was not the case.

We flew out Premium Economy for the first time. It was not worth it. As we were late taking off they were serving a roast chicken dinner at midnight and breakfast two hours later. There was no amenity kit and the chairs while roomy, the new feet rests just didnt work great. Mine kept ""dropping"" down. My mothers couldnt get down. We spoke to other passengers who were there and they agreed it was just not worth the price paid. Just stick to economy. It was also nothing like the TV adverts.

Returning home we flew business class. I was pretty disgusted. It was an old plane which they are ""tarted"" up. The lights in the toilets didnt work. The outside lights showing if the toilets were occupied didnt work. The toilets were dirty and smelly. Food was prepared right beside the toilets with no screen or anything. 4 toilets right next door to the kitchen. Disgusting. The seats were smaller than the premium economy ones. Tiny! Lie flat didnt really happen - it was so tight and my feet were crushed in the box where feet were supposed to go and im only 5:8. As for the table in the seat. Unless you were a size 0, it was going to be difficult to get the tray out. What a silly way to put a table. Even my 11 year old son could hardly get it out. Once I did, the table dipped to the back so my soup was spilled as soon as it was put down. Again, there was no amenity kits - nothing. Even the staff were complaining that the plane was pretty rubbish. How emirates can justify charging for luxury conditions in these circumstances is beyond me. I can understand if it was lovely chairs as I have had before but there was hardly that. This means that some people are paying the same price for luxury and some are sitting squashed up and uncomfortable. As usual; when I spoke to emirates about this they have not offered any compensation apart from some air miles.

Emirates when I first flew with them were wonderful. Staff took your coat and hung it up, they were right over with a glass of champage or juice and paper. and the food was delicious. You felt extremely spoilt. Whatever they are doing now - it just doesnt work plus they seem to be getting more and more expensive.",2,,emirates have gone downhill having travelled with emirates several times before it is sad to see a once brilliant airline slowly decline when i first few with them they were excellent i have just returned from another holiday to dubai and flew from heathrow we travelled to heathrow from scotland as we were looking for a better standard of plane sadly this was not the case we flew out premium economy for the first time it was not worth it as we were late taking off they were serving a roast chicken dinner at midnight and breakfast two hours later there was no amenity kit and the chairs while roomy the new feet rests just didnt work great mine kept dropping down my mothers couldnt get down we spoke to other passengers who were there and they agreed it was just not worth the price paid just stick to economy it was also nothing like the tv adverts returning home we flew business class i was pretty disgusted it was an old plane which they are tarted up the lights in the toilets didnt work the outside lights showing if the toilets were occupied didnt work the toilets were dirty and smelly food was prepared right beside the toilets with no screen or anything toilets right next door to the kitchen disgusting the seats were smaller than the premium economy ones tiny lie flat didnt really happen it was so tight and my feet were crushed in the box where feet were supposed to go and im only as for the table in the seat unless you were a size it was going to be difficult to get the tray out what a silly way to put a table even my year old son could hardly get it out once i did the table dipped to the back so my soup was spilled as soon as it was put down again there was no amenity kits nothing even the staff were complaining that the plane was pretty rubbish how emirates can justify charging for luxury conditions in these circumstances is beyond me i can understand if it was lovely chairs as i have had before but there was hardly that this means that some people are paying the same price for luxury and some are sitting squashed up and uncomfortable as usual when i spoke to emirates about this they have not offered any compensation apart from some air miles emirates when i first flew with them were wonderful staff took your coat and hung it up they were right over with a glass of champage or juice and paper and the food was delicious you felt extremely spoilt whatever they are doing now it just doesnt work plus they seem to be getting more and more expensive ,0.6577,Positive,Cabin Crew

Flight was overbooked and despite paying extra money for our seats, we were first told we were being put on standby for the flight the next day. When I said this was not acceptable as other people who had been behind us in the queue were being given seats. They agreed to put us on the flight but had given our seats to other passengers so we had to sit in a 4 seat block in the middle of the plane, no apology...

RY,United Kingdom,7,"Such a terrible experience
Such a terrible experience - We flew from London to Denpasar ( a very long flight) and on the first leg of the trip to Dubai, due to a mistake they made when booking a vegetarian meal over the phone, they gave us a terrible option for vegetarians- we were given vegetarian Jain which is a type of vegan option, no root vegetables and no onions or garlic, but very cheaply put together, so the poor people on this diet had a terrible option + the dessert was a cheap children’s raisin boxes, mine was a crunched up box and raisins exposed which was unhygienic . No proper desserts, no cheese and biscuits, a plain dry hard bread role, flavourless orzo and a salty dhal curry and rice dish. I imagine food in a correctional facility would be better. There were vegetarian options on board but because they had assigned us with Jain meal we were not allowed one and the attitude was unkind, unfriendly and you really were made to feel like economy second rate passengers, reminded meal options should be selected before the flight - which we did - they just assigned the wrong option. On the second part of the flight a kind ground staff member named Maria and the flight manager offered us a vegetarian meal which they had spare because they felt sorry for us and wanted us to have at least one meal on the 19hr journey.
Emirates need to do better with their food, their staff, their attitude towards economy passengers - even Emirates economy flights are expensive and there are cheaper options with other airlines. I am just very sad BA did not have flight options to our destination, they have always been reliable and 1st class for customer service.

Seat Change after paying £312.

Deciding to take the option of extra leg room seats even after the extra £78 per seat Emirates charge it was annoying to find that prior to departure the four of us had been placed back into standard seats with no refund. Talking to the airline apaprently this was due to a plane change configuration but even though extra leg room seats were available on the new plane, we were put back into standard seats and advised that we should seek a refund from the airline on our return.
This is totally unacceptable. If passengers are going to be moved around after paying so much for seats then then a refund should immediately be supplied or at least the same type chairs given on the new configuration.

Giffard Sercombe,United Kingdom,26,"Terrible service
I had a poor experience on this flight. I have been using Emirates' services for over 20 years, being a Blue member and, then, a Silver member, up until the time of covid. I have had no reason to complain, previously about Emirates’ service.
Sitting in seat 30F, I had ordered vegetarian food, and received a snack soon after take-off, along with a sealed cup of water. Subsequently, meals for other passengers were brought round and people were offered drinks, but I was offered nothing, and the steward moved on too quickly for me to request a drink.
At the next opportunity, when a steward passed by, I requested a drink, but was advised to wait until lunch was served (a very poor response, I felt). I reiterated: I would like a drink as soon as possible (as I was thirsty). The person in seat 30G was asleep and i could not exit the seat with causing a disturbance. A drink was subsequently provided (but over 15 minutes later). However, the table in 30F is/was not secure and the drink slid off, spilled over me and the person in 30G next to me. The people sitting either side of me were more helpful than the steward in trying to clear up the mess.
Later on, lunch did arrive, but it was 2 hours after I had first requested a drink (so, my request for a drink had been vindicated). When food trays were later collected, mine was overlooked, the steward passed me by, and my food tray was left for over half an hour. When a steward passed by, I asked that the tray be removed and could not understand why I was being treated in what seemed a negligent manner. At this point, I was beginning to become very fed up.
A supervisor later came round and asked if I was alright. I was fine (albeit tired), but frustrated at having been ignored and overlooked. The supervisor was firm, but unapologetic, and asked me if i needed anything. I did not need anything, and she left me without further comment, her enquiry appearing pointless to me, as it solved nothing.
Following this experience, I am unlikely to use Emirates again, which has left me thoroughly disillusioned with the company.",1,,terrible service i had a poor experience on this flight i have been using emirates services for over years being a blue member and then a silver member up until the time of covid i have had no reason to complain previously about emirates service sitting in seat f i had ordered vegetarian food and received a snack soon after take off along with a sealed cup of water subsequently meals for other passengers were brought round and people were offered drinks but i was offered nothing and the steward moved on too quickly for me to request a drink at the next opportunity when a steward passed by i requested a drink but was advised to wait until lunch was served a very poor response i felt i reiterated i would like a drink as soon as possible as i was thirsty the person in seat g was asleep and i could not exit the seat with causing a disturbance a drink was subsequently provided but over minutes later however the table in f is was not secure and the drink slid off spilled over me and the person in g next to me the people sitting either side of me were more helpful than the steward in trying to clear up the mess later on lunch did arrive but it was hours after i had first requested a drink so my request for a drink had been vindicated when food trays were later collected mine was overlooked the steward passed me by and my food tray was left for over half an hour when a steward passed by i asked that the tray be removed and could not understand why i was being treated in what seemed a negligent manner at this point i was beginning to become very fed up a supervisor later came round and asked if i was alright i was fine albeit tired but frustrated at having been ignored and overlooked the supervisor was firm but unapologetic and asked me if i needed anything i did not need anything and she left me without further comment her enquiry appearing pointless to me as it solved nothing following this experience i am unlikely to use emirates again which has left me thoroughly disillusioned with the company ,-0.8932,Negative,Cabin Crew

NT,United Kingdom,6,"VERY BAD Emirates customer service from Dubai Airport (The HUB of airline travel!!!!)
After having a holiday in Dubai for 7 days, we were travelling from Dubai to Mumbai and flying with Emirates Airlines. On the 22/01/2022 at approximately 02:00 we were at the check-in desks to check in the luggage and passengers.
We were travelling with 60 kg of luggage (30 kg per passenger) and 2 hand luggage trolleys of 7 kg each as per entitlement. We requested at the check-in desk to kindly check in our hand luggage as well because I was travelling with a baby and it would be difficult to handle a baby/pram and a hand trolley. The request was refused stating that we have reached the check-in allowance limit of 60 kg, but I accentuated to remind the agent that I am traveling with my child and it is difficult to travel with 2 extra hand trolleys. The agent kept refusing even showing him that I have my child that I am travelling with so how can Emirates expect me to travel with a pram and 2 trolleys but sadly and shockingly the request was refused.
My husband (who was not travelling but dropping us off) made an input to accentuate and understand the situation fully. My husband mentioned that it is almost impossible to travel with a baby, pram and 2 hand trolleys but the agent was failing to understand and was being inconsiderate.
My husband requested that we would like to speak to a supervisor to raise this concern with them. The agent went away and spoke to the supervisor named Kumail. After a short while the agent came back and said that the supervisor also agrees that the hand luggage cannot be checked in. We were getting really concerned at this point, so my husband asked the agent that he wants to personally speak to the supervisor. It was a disgrace to hear that the agent at the desk said to my husband that the supervisor is behind and ‘you can go there and speak to him’. This is just very bad customer service. My husband said that we are a customer, so the agent’s job is to make life easier for travelling customers and all customers overall so call the supervisor to the desk.
The agent went away to call Kumail over to the desk and my husband kindly and gently clarified to him that my wife is travelling alone with a baby so understand that it is near impossible to travel with 2 hand luggage trolleys with our baby and the pram and pointed to blame that we needed to plan better. We were very shocked to hear this. We have travelled with Emirates before and many other airlines and it is just common courtesy to assist passengers to make travel a pleasant and easy journey and enjoyable. After hearing this we found that it was illogical and disrespectful and a customer service agent with the status of a supervisor must never speak to any customers in such a manner.
In our defence we were very shocked to hear that they are not fulfilling our request to check in the hand luggage trolleys because every time we fly with emirates they use the common courtesy to take the hand luggage in even without a request and other airlines follow the same principle when travelling with a child.
We found this very inconsistent and impertinent, so we went ahead to complain to the manager and asked that we want to speak to a manager immediately.
After a long wait the manager came and gave my husband an opportunity to explain the situation that we are unable to travel with a baby and 2 hand luggage trolleys together. The manager named Anisa Ameer was 100% absolutely and extremely discourteous person to communicate with. She said the same thing that the hand luggage trolleys cannot be checked in and totally failed to understand that it is near impossible to travel with it and was giving us no further options. She was especially impolite, disrespectful. I cannot stress enough how rude Anisa was. She would talk in a loud tone, would not let us talk and therefore because we had enough we wanted to escalate this matter with urgency and asked that we want to speak to a higher acting manager who we can make them understand that it is common sense and common courtesy to check in hand luggage trolleys when travelling with a baby.
Anisa went away to make a phone call and after another long wait she came back to advise that she can check in 1 hand trolley only and we had to carry the other which was the most extreme difficult task to accomplish when pushing a pram.
When I said ‘Thank you’ to show my appreciation she brusquely rolled her eyes and walked away with some sort of pride!
There was absolutely no help offered as part of the customer service that is supposed to be offered and most disappointingly, she watched us struggle when we were going through to the border control counters.
We found this hurtful and we were very sad, emotional and in tears.

Having used Emirates for many years, business class, and first class, living in Dubai and commuting regularly to London and the rest of the world, I was in Ibiza for three weeks this summer, all booked via emirates, business class, and when I got to the airport and Ibiza to come home, Emirates sun airline, Air Europa, had a four hour delay on my flight, which meant I missed my connection.
There was absolutely no help, no communication, and no way to deal with it other than to cancel the flights and rebook a different route myself.
This cost me an additional 20,000 Dirhams (over £5k).
Emirates response having finally got hold of them when I got home to Dubai was, and I quote “This is not our problem, read the small print; speak to Air Europa.”
Even having booked the entire trip through Emirates they have absolutely no interest in even acknowledging the problem.
I have written to every C suite member of the company and been essentially laughed at.

Ash Wright,United Kingdom,15,"Infant denied food and plane leak
I raised a complain with emirates two weeks ago and haven’t heard a response. Unfortunately, despite being a regular flyer, I have had to resort to putting my complaint here in hope of a response.

Myself and my family (Partner and Infant) had a very poor experience on our overall return leg of our trip, however the second leg from Dubai to London was horrible. Issue 1 - As you can see from the image attached, I was seated where a leak occurred.

This occurred approximately 15 minutes after take-off from Dubai. I had dozed off and had woken to my socks absolutely soaked. I immediately raised this to the attendant who literally said ""No no there is no leak"". I then got out my torch, showed her the floor and showed her my socks. She did not apologise and simply stated ""hold on please"" and then said for us to use one of our blankets as the flight was fully booked and they had nothing else to cover this with. This meant that I had no blanket for my trip, had a constant puddle beneath my feet and subsequently, no socks. After about 3 hours into the trip, the blanket was quite damp and I had to continue sitting in an awkward posture.

Issue 2 - Before take-off, after take off and at meal service we both asked for our infant meal (The Ella sachet you provided). On the first two occasions we were told this would be brought, it was not. Now despite the above issue, understanding it was busy with a full A380 flight, we were patient. On the third occasion my wife asked the attended assigned to the opposite aisle (Petite Brunette girl) for the infant food and said ""No I cant"" and literally ran off up the aisle (upward in sequence) and we had to then wait another 30 minutes to get the sachet.

This simply isn't good enough, my baby was hungry, I was forced to use my blanket to sit in a puddle (which the other attending denied initially).

I am awaiting a response to know how you will remedy this situation.",1,,infant denied food and plane leak i raised a complain with emirates two weeks ago and haven t heard a response unfortunately despite being a regular flyer i have had to resort to putting my complaint here in hope of a response myself and my family partner and infant had a very poor experience on our overall return leg of our trip however the second leg from dubai to london was horrible issue as you can see from the image attached i was seated where a leak occurred this occurred approximately minutes after take off from dubai i had dozed off and had woken to my socks absolutely soaked i immediately raised this to the attendant who literally said no no there is no leak i then got out my torch showed her the floor and showed her my socks she did not apologise and simply stated hold on please and then said for us to use one of our blankets as the flight was fully booked and they had nothing else to cover this with this meant that i had no blanket for my trip had a constant puddle beneath my feet and subsequently no socks after about hours into the trip the blanket was quite damp and i had to continue sitting in an awkward posture issue before take off after take off and at meal service we both asked for our infant meal the ella sachet you provided on the first two occasions we were told this would be brought it was not now despite the above issue understanding it was busy with a full a flight we were patient on the third occasion my wife asked the attended assigned to the opposite aisle petite brunette girl for the infant food and said no i cant and literally ran off up the aisle upward in sequence and we had to then wait another minutes to get the sachet this simply isn t good enough my baby was hungry i was forced to use my blanket to sit in a puddle which the other attending denied initially i am awaiting a response to know how you will remedy this situation ,-0.9718,Negative,Cabin Crew

I paid a premium price for my Emirates tickets from Europe to Australia – twice as much as I'd previously paid with Singapore Airlines, which had always provided an exceptional experience. Naturally, my expectations were high. Unfortunately, Emirates' 'world class' reputation didn't align with the reality of my journey.

The cabin crew, while not unfriendly, were notably inattentive. Passengers were frequently overlooked, and water rounds were infrequent. The catering was disappointing, with food quality being surprisingly low. The aircraft itself was aging and poorly maintained, giving the impression of a budget carrier rather than a premium airline. The extensive advertising for Dubai felt intrusive and didn't compensate for the lackluster service.

Midway through the 25-hour journey, the bathrooms were already in a deplorable state. Several passengers became unwell, with some even vomiting in the aisle. Fellow passengers stepped in to help, offering their own water bottles, as staff were slow to respond. The situation was truly unsettling.

By the end of the flight, many passengers agreed that Emirates felt like an overpriced budget airline with excellent PR but little substance. Communication with customer service before and after the flight was challenging, with staff coming across as unhelpful and sometimes even rude.

In summary, my experience with Emirates was disappointing, especially given the high cost of the tickets.

Kim,Australia,6,"Lost Baggage, Zero Commmunication, No Compensation
Paid >$5000 to fly with Emirates for a holiday that ended up in disaster.

We booked a flight from BNE to DUB, but the first leg of the flight was with Qantas on 8/7/23 (QF51) to Singapore. We had an overnight transit and checked in at the Transer C desk to make sure our suitcases get transferred over to Emirates as advised by a Qantas staff in BNE. We checked before our flight on 9/7/23 (EK405) morning to Dubai at the same desk to make sure our suitcases were with Emirates and on their way with us. We were advised
that BOTH were with Emirates. However, when we arrived in Dublin 9/7/23 (EK163) night, my suitcase never turned up, while my husband's did. Today is Day 27 and they are ""still tracing it"".

That suitcase has five weeks' worth of clothes, supplements, and skincare products. I am in a foreign country without basic necessities and I had to spend money on things I didn't plan on. Most of the stuffs I have in there are not able to be purchased here. My holiday has become a disaster because of this mess 🤬

Up to this day, no one has contacted me to give me ANY update on their search. I keep having to chase them up via emails, live chats, and phone calls.

People at the call centre are hopeless and clueless. They give different information every time I speak to them. First they told me it was never transferred to them by Qantas in Singapore, then it was checked-in but never made it on the plane to Dubai, and then they said they are waiting for Singapore and Qantas to respond to their emails and that they can only communicate via emails because there is no contact number. Any escalation made will require at least 8 business hours for a response, which I never received, even until today 🙄

I wrote complaints on their websites and their response was just an email to say they will get back to me within 30 days 🤣

I also have not received, or even been offered, any compensation for the items I had to purchase because of this incident.

What kind of customer service is this?

It would have been nicer to at least get daily/regular updates about this issue.

S Uppal,United Kingdom,3,"A Disappointing Experience with Emirates Customer Service
I recently had an unfortunate encounter with Emirates' customer service that left me deeply dissatisfied with their level of professionalism and willingness to assist. The incident occurred when I booked an upgrade, only to realize later that I was not eligible for certain services. Rather than receiving the understanding and assistance I expected, I encountered rude and unhelpful representatives who seemed more interested in ending the conversation than addressing my concerns.

When I initially booked my upgrade, I was not informed about the limitations and exclusions associated with the service. However, upon discovering this discrepancy, I decided to contact Emirates' customer service in hopes of finding a resolution. Politeness and understanding were my primary expectations, but unfortunately, these were not met.

The customer service representative I encountered displayed a dismissive attitude from the very start of the conversation. Despite my polite request for assistance and clarification, the representative seemed uninterested in helping me. Their lack of empathy and unwillingness to address my concerns left me feeling unheard and disrespected.

What was most disappointing was the abrupt and unhelpful response I received. Instead of taking the time to softly explain the situation or explore alternative options, the representative simply thanked me for contacting them and swiftly ended the conversation. This interaction left a lot to be desired in terms of customer service standards and left me feeling frustrated and undervalued as a customer.

In situations like these, it is crucial for customer service representatives to exhibit patience, empathy, and a genuine desire to assist their customers. Clear communication is also essential, particularly when it comes to informing customers about any limitations or restrictions on the services they are purchasing. Unfortunately, my experience with Emirates' customer service fell short in all these aspects.

While I understand that every company can have occasional lapses in their customer service, it is disheartening when a renowned airline like Emirates fails to meet expectations. As a loyal customer, I had hoped for a more positive experience, especially when seeking assistance regarding an issue that was not entirely my fault.

In conclusion, my encounter with Emirates' customer service was disappointing and fell short of what I would consider satisfactory. The lack of empathy, unwillingness to assist, and abrupt ending of the conversation left a negative impression. I hope that Emirates takes this feedback constructively and works towards improving their customer service standards to ensure that other customers do not have to endure similar experiences.",1,8/4/2023,a disappointing experience with emirates customer service i recently had an unfortunate encounter with emirates customer service that left me deeply dissatisfied with their level of professionalism and willingness to assist the incident occurred when i booked an upgrade only to realize later that i was not eligible for certain services rather than receiving the understanding and assistance i expected i encountered rude and unhelpful representatives who seemed more interested in ending the conversation than addressing my concerns when i initially booked my upgrade i was not informed about the limitations and exclusions associated with the service however upon discovering this discrepancy i decided to contact emirates customer service in hopes of finding a resolution politeness and understanding were my primary expectations but unfortunately these were not met the customer service representative i encountered displayed a dismissive attitude from the very start of the conversation despite my polite request for assistance and clarification the representative seemed uninterested in helping me their lack of empathy and unwillingness to address my concerns left me feeling unheard and disrespected what was most disappointing was the abrupt and unhelpful response i received instead of taking the time to softly explain the situation or explore alternative options the representative simply thanked me for contacting them and swiftly ended the conversation this interaction left a lot to be desired in terms of customer service standards and left me feeling frustrated and undervalued as a customer in situations like these it is crucial for customer service representatives to exhibit patience empathy and a genuine desire to assist their customers clear communication is also essential particularly when it comes to informing customers about any limitations or restrictions on the services they are purchasing unfortunately my experience with emirates customer service fell short in all these aspects while i understand that every company can have occasional lapses in their customer service it is disheartening when a renowned airline like emirates fails to meet expectations as a loyal customer i had hoped for a more positive experience especially when seeking assistance regarding an issue that was not entirely my fault in conclusion my encounter with emirates customer service was disappointing and fell short of what i would consider satisfactory the lack of empathy unwillingness to assist and abrupt ending of the conversation left a negative impression i hope that emirates takes this feedback constructively and works towards improving their customer service standards to ensure that other customers do not have to endure similar experiences ,0.9116,Positive,Cabin Crew

But now that I want to book the free hotel night, I got the feedback: ""'. On reading the last line on the terms and conditions, you see the statement says ""The ticket must be issued on an Emirates (176) document."" This is the base of the reason for denying the service.

Luca S.,United States,2,"A Disappointing Journey with Emirates: Misleading Policies, Unresponsiveness, and Safety Concerns
My last trip with Emirates has been deeply disappointing, marked by frustrating incidents that raise concerns about the airline's commitment to customer satisfaction and safety. The issues I encountered include a significant problem with their cancellation policy, lack of responsiveness from their customer service team, concerning safety practices, refusal to reimburse for damaged luggage, an extensive delay during the return flight, and a stark contrast in service quality between Economy and Business class.

Regarding the cancellation policy, I received misleading information from three representatives, who assured me (on a monitored and recorded line) that I would receive a full refund if I canceled within 24 hours. However, they failed to mention the crucial condition that this only applied when the flight was at least 7 days after the initial booking. As a result, I tried to cancel within the 24-hour window but could only reschedule. This costed me a $500 loss vs. the option of cancelling and booking a new flight for the following day. Despite Emirates acknowledging in writing their mistake, they repeatedly refused to provide a price match or refund, and eventually even stopped replying to my follow up messages on the open complain.

The lack of responsiveness from Emirates compounded my frustration. Numerous follow-up messages went unanswered, showing a lack of interest in resolving the issues I faced. It is disheartening to be met with silence and indifference after such a disappointing experience.

During the flight, I was alarmed by a safety practice where all blankets were collected and piled in front of the emergency exits to save time (see attached pictures). This compromises passenger safety by potentially impeding access to emergency exits during an evacuation. Safety should never be compromised for convenience and cost cutting.

Emirates also declined to reimburse me for one of two damaged pieces of luggage, despite the damage occurring during their handling. This refusal to take responsibility for passengers' belongings is disappointing and reflects a lack of care.

Furthermore, the return flight experienced a significant delay for a missing document, resulting in passengers being seated on the plane for over two hours, including boarding time. Despite the delay being just a few minutes short of two hours, the lack of updates, assistance, and provisions such as free Wi-Fi or refreshments left passengers feeling inconvenienced and neglected.

The stark contrast between my previous exceptional experiences in Business class and this subpar Economy class trip is disheartening. The service quality and care for Economy class travelers fall short of expectations.

In conclusion, my trip with Emirates in Economy class has been marked by disappointment and frustration. The misleading cancellation policy, unresponsiveness, inadequate handling of luggage, safety concerns, lack of consideration during delays, and disparity between Economy and Business class experiences paint a negative picture of the airline's commitment to customer satisfaction.

I purchased the upgrade, but got the confirmation email and immediately realized the upgrade price was only for one leg to Dubai. I called them immediately within 5 minutes of making the purchase of their promotion email telling them I assumed it was for my flight to Lisbon..... not just half my flight. They refused and would not refund. Sooooo misleading. I never booked a ticket to Dubai - I only booked a ticket to Lisbon so was not expecting them to email me with a flight offer for half my flight. So annoying they were so rude and wouldn't help, within 5 minutes of making the purchase. After experiencing their customer service, I will never fly with this RUDE team again.",1,,misleading and terribly rude customer service terrible customer experience i had a flight bali to lisbon a couple of days before departure i got an email with an offer for a business upgrade i purchased the upgrade but got the confirmation email and immediately realized the upgrade price was only for one leg to dubai i called them immediately within minutes of making the purchase of their promotion email telling them i assumed it was for my flight to lisbon not just half my flight they refused and would not refund sooooo misleading i never booked a ticket to dubai i only booked a ticket to lisbon so was not expecting them to email me with a flight offer for half my flight so annoying they were so rude and wouldn t help within minutes of making the purchase after experiencing their customer service i will never fly with this rude team again ,-0.9604,Negative,Cabin Crew
David Clifton,United Kingdom,10,"Diabolical cheap skate Customer Service
New suitcase proven by submitted photos, written off in transit, which was a gift.
Because l had not got a receipt, being a gift, they used that excuse to only offer me fifty per cent of the replacement cost.
My experience corresponding with their Customer Services was absolutely diabolical, where my points were continually stone walled by a character called Turfene",1,,diabolical cheap skate customer service new suitcase proven by submitted photos written off in transit which was a gift because l had not got a receipt being a gift they used that excuse to only offer me fifty per cent of the replacement cost my experience corresponding with their customer services was absolutely diabolical where my points were continually stone walled by a character called turfene,0.8442,Positive,Cabin Crew

Their service is soo goood! Never had the chance to flight first class on Emirates yet, but I am definitely hoping that one day I will get it. Even the economy is super high class, if you compare it to other regional or even some of the international airlines anywhere in the world. They are fast, they are meticulous, very kind and polite staff, the planes are always comfy, the food is super great and fresh.",,7/11/2023,their service is soo goood their service is soo goood never had the chance to flight first class on emirates yet but i am definitely hoping that one day i will get it even the economy is super high class if you compare it to other regional or even some of the international airlines anywhere in the world they are fast they are meticulous very kind and polite staff the planes are always comfy the food is super great and fresh ,0.9875,Positive,Cabin Crew
